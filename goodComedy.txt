"Mrs. Doubtfire" is an extremely funny and heartfelt film. It has tons of laughs as well as tears, this is definitly Robin Williams' best film. Watching williams do voices as well as play Mrs. Doubtfire is a real treat. Also the supporting cast of actors do an excellent job, I highly reccomend it.I was a young girl the first time I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. I was introduced to the movie by my parents. While some of the movies lines are "inappropriate", I still think that the movie is a Important and heartwarming film that every family should watch together. Despite the Films PG-13 rating, I don't really see anything inappropriate about the film. If anything people can watch the film to see the comedic genius that (was) Robin Williams. People can also learn a wonderful message from the form. No family is perfect, and sometimes families won't be together but that doesn't mean that there is no love. Love is sprinkled all throughout this film and that's probably what makes it's withstand the test of time. While Robin Williams is sadly no longer with us, his comedic timing and adlibbing of fantastic one liners will live on forever through Mrs. Doubtfire and so many other wonderful films. I encourage every family to watch this film together, it will touch your life forever.R I P to one of the best actors Robin Williams
You gave so much value to the filmographyGreat family movie! Robin Williams excels again! Haven't laughed so much since the Birdcage when Williams outdid himself once again! Don't just rent this one, buy it! It's worth watching over and over again. Sally Field brings a wonderful touch to the movie too. My family really enjoyed the "tea scene with the social worker". And let's not forget the "cooking scene" that goes haywire! This movie will have you laughing hysterically over and over again at the many comedic scenes. Can't wait to see what 2007 will bring with the new release of Mrs. Doubtfire II. All I can say is "What took so long?" Make this a family night & enjoy! Add this to your collection, you won't regret it!RIP ROB the world loves you. This movie was my childhood favorite and decided to re watch it again after so many years. Still so many heartwarming tears. Great plot not many movies out there like this anymore.Mrs. Doubtfire is a great comedy for many reasons. 1.) Robin Williams is brilliant in almost any movie he makes, including this movie. 2.) It's great for the whole family which is kind of rare. 3.) It shows that a man can absolutely love his children and want to be a part of their lives. 4.) The music fits the movie and is great. 5.) It's heart-warming as well as funny.This is one of the best movies of Fall-Dawn funny, comical, and impressive.Daniel Hirard, played by Robin Willams, who is losing his job are declared divorce by his wife. And he has to separate from his wife and 3 children.One day, he decide he will be housekeeper to meet his family. He makes up and become MRS.DOUATFIRE....I really like this movie because this is a family comedy movie and it is warming movie. The plot teach us about importance of family. The performance are amazing and powerful all around.I would have never thought that I would see Robin Williams dress up as a sixty-something year old Nanny.  Never in my entire life.  I first thought that this movie would be a waste of my time.  I was dead wrong.  This movie is hilarious.  Robin Williams is excellent as a divorced man, in order to get closer to his kids, dresses up as a nanny of his ex-wife.  Sally Field is very good as Robin's ex-wife.  The entire movie is very good.Overall the whole movie is excellent with good direction and acting. Rating 10 out of 10.Mrs. Doubtfire is for sure a movie you can't miss. One of Robin Williams best. Really shows you the meaning of love between a single father and his children.What an absolutely delightful film. Let's just start with the Performances. Robin Williams gives an energetic, wonderful and talented performance. He should have won an Academy Award. The rest of the cast, containing are truly brilliant with their supporting jobs. Neither one tries to outdo their role, making sure that the limelight stayed on Robin Williams. It is a film that as incredibly funny in so many ways, yet at the some time saddening. It addresses an issue that confronts many children, the issue of divorce. The film confronts this issue without making a joke of it or making the film depressing. The portrayal of a family is so superb in this film that it will live for generations to come. It is an outstanding motion picture that leaves the audience with laughs and tears, a rare combination making in one of Hollywood's finest.Absolutely loved it!!!
One of the few movies I have been wishing they would make a sequel of for years! The first is definitely one of my favorites, and this one will be going up on that list with the first. It just almost surpasses the first, almost.... At the very least it is definitely equal to the first in every aspect. I purposely avoided the trailers and everything talking about it over the past few months as I didn't want to know anything until I got to see it lol...This movie is one of my favorite movies of 2019. Not only is the action good but it is outstandingly hilarious. Every minute of the movie I laughed. 10/10 for me."Zombieland: Double Tap" is the #1 Movie in America so far, it's hilariously funny, it brings out the most joy of zombie comedy, and it's brings out "Shaun of the Dead, and "The Walking Dead" reference. It's just like the first film, in some other way of to enjoy the little things. But for this second film of Zombieland: Double Tap, you're gonna enjoy a lot of things.Every bit as good as the first one... of not better!
I'll be going to see it again... and I cannot remember the last time I went to see a movie multiple times!The best movie of the year !!! fantastic! It was the funniest 90 min of this year!Woody does it again! Hilarious,great story,brilliant sequel! I hope they make another. Cameos were great as well.Hilarious great blast! Bigger budget, new characters, amazing dialogue, and awesome soundtrack! I laughed more and louder than anyone else which to me was so nice. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Some suspenseful bits were so great and the surprises were perfect, I won't spoil, I will just say I am very satisfied with everything. Delighted I got to see a double feature event so much fun and early release is nice; I hope my opinions are appreciated I am trying to be known with my reviews either way I feel at peace.I totally recommend this if you liked the first zombieland and it's another one of those rare times where a sequel doesn't suck, just grab some snacks, bring some friends, have fun, and laugh your ass off10 long years we have waited for this sequel. In a world full of sequels no one has ever really asked for, Zombieland: Double Tap is quite an interesting case. Judging by the current IMDb rating (7.2) it seems to be well received.
So, does it have a life-changing story? No.
Does it have an interesting plot twist? No.
Was it worth watching? Absolutely!
Unlike most sequels, Zombieland did not spit out it's sequel a year or two after. This, whether intended or not, made sure that fans would not grow tired of this world. Compared to the Fast and Furious franchise or the Pirates of the Carribbean. watching this sequel does not feel like a chore.
As such, it does not need any revolutionary new elements to the plot.
It does not need any deeper themes mirroring current issues. hough I think there were quite a few minor jabs at vegans/animal activists, which might explain the comparetively low critics score on rotten tomatoes.Considering Harrelson is a vegan himself though, these jokes just seem harmless and not overly political. Generally, I must say I have really enjoyed watching a movie that does not prioritize its political message of diversity, empowerment and god knows what over everything.
Sometimes all you need is more of the same. And that is what you get watching Zombieland: Double Tap. Definitely worth a watch. I will watch it again soon.I had low expectation coming to see the sequel after enjoying the first one . But damn they delivered it .. great movie , great new characters ..We've waited 10 years for this and people it didn't disappoint. Followed on from the first movie. The one liners were epic.. Story line may not win any oscars but this movie is a must see if you enjoyed the first.10/10Everything you expect and more .. Fun and Action and good new characters .. With a beautiful storyI enjoy this second film more than first one. It much funnier and great sense of humor! I love it a lot! Probably my favorite zombie movie right now!10/10Hands up I never saw the original Zombieland, but what a blast Double Tap is. The whole cinema was roaring with laughter. Director Ruben Fleischer takes his four gunslingers and upgrades their accommodation, it's the White House baby. Just a little pruning in the garden first. The zombies have also had an upgrade. Categorised from Homer to Hawking, Ninja and T-800s. Damm they're hard to kill, even with double-tap.Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is Commander in Chief in the newly requisitioned White House, queue the music, and Abigail Breslin is the unhappy First Daughter. Little Rock is looking for more excitement with kids her own age. Difficult in a zombie apocalypse. But there's always Christmas (any day you like), and Lincoln doesn't need his gun anymore (I think it was his), so Tallahassee gifts it to Little Rock. And her sister Wichita played by Emma Stone gets no less than the Hope diamond as an engagement ring from Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus. Love is sweet.But things don't always go to plan and the boys find themselves alone when the girls split, and fancying a little retail therapy one day. Columbus loves candles, of course he does, and of all the candle departments in all the world wanders Madison. Played by Zoey Deutch in pink, she has survived the 'acropolis' by living in a freezer and being blonde. Because zombies eat brains says Tallahassee. Ouch. She's a scream. And she and Columbus hit it off. Tallahassee not so much.But in all horror movies there's always a bang in the night, (or several going on upstairs in the Lincoln bedroom), as Wichita comes back for more guns. Maybe she thought her and Columbus were on a break, when she meets Madison. But she's back now because Little Rock has gone off with a musician hippie called Berkely to live in a peace loving commune called Babylon. Avan Jogia is gorgeous but sprinkling patchouli oil and passing Bob Dylan songs off as his own will not stop the zombie hordes. And Tallahassee is not happy he's a musician, that gag never gets old, so the gang (plus Madison, sans luggage) need to saddle up and rescue Little Rock. Even from herself.It's hilarious with snappy one liners and crazy zombie comic book kills. And the best Zombie Kill of the Year is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. What a roll. The minivan ride not so much as Little Rock took Tallahassee's motor; the Presidential Beast. But the destination is Memphis and Graceland. And Tallahassee is a huge fan. En-route Madison may take a hit for the team with trail mix, but she'll show up again.And for Gone With The Wind fans Gracelands now looks like Twelve Oaks after Sherman rode through. But there is a little motel nearby that doubles as an Elvis museum, and sweet, the Beast is parked outside. Little Rock and Berkely are gone but inside are the mythical blue suede shoes that fit Columbus just so. But Tallahassee looks cool in white. It's run by Rosario Dawson's badass Nevada, she's a big fan of the King. And she has some friends. Her ex Luke Wilson's Albuquerque and his side kick Flagstaff, played by Thomas Middleditch, are the Ross and Russ to Tallahassee and Columbus. As Wichita stays on the side line. But those new T-800's are ferocious little buggers who just won't stay down. Bit like the new Rev-9 of the future! Elvis would turn in his grave at the carnage.But after tearful goodbyes, eventually our would be rescuers arrive at Babylon, where crazily all guns are melted down. And seeing that Little Rock wants to stay Tallahassee decides to head out West and find his true Indian self. Just as our hippies are celebrating with fireworks. They always draw a crowd..of zombies. So armed with nothing, Tallahassee turns around the minivan for one heroic last stand with hippies versus the zombies.There may have been some mean spirited Venom from critics, that's twice then! But the A-list actors looked like they were having a ball. As a standalone film it was fantastic fun, it was easy to pick up the storyline! and I loved the goofy horror and screen bullet points. Chung-hoon Chung created a great zombie wasteland with Martin Whist's production design. Great job.My brother and I went last night. It's a good thing it was a Monday night and the theater was lightly attended. We were laughing so loudly at so many times during the movie. We weren't alone. Laughter from every corner of the theater.A great successor to the original.This is a pure comedy movie enjoy the moments and the situational comedy. If you like more intense zombie movies or serials please stick to walking dread and stay at homeNeeds third movie so funny even better than first movie go see for sure worth doing friendHonestly the best movie of 2019 by far. If you liked the first one, this steps up by miles, so you'll love it!Perfect mix between comedy, action and just all round awesomeness. This is my first time actually writing a quick review so take it from me this is worth seeing at the movies 10/10I never usually give rating out but this movie is just as good as the first for me personally, I really wished they did not mess up with the new involvement of actors but they fit right in the comedy is on par with the first and if you liked the first definitely will the second. The second movies usually aren't as good as the first but this one killed it. This is my opinion as I am a huge fan of the first and now of the second.EDIT: I have now watched this movie 3 Times and plan on watching it the fourth, something about this movie is really just making me love it more and more... I genuinely think it is now better then the first one to me. This is my personal opinion and some may feel different but I now have this movie ranked as my 2nd favourite movie of all time no joke.I can't believe how they got very lucky to make a sequel from very long wait from very first sequel zombieland (2009) i remember seeing this film in 9th grade and this come out theaters as well i remember how popular it was, then production had issues making sequel, they said they won't make sequel and it won't happen i am like that's very disappointing and depressing sadly Woody Harrelson I don't know. I don't feel like a sequels guy and he said I've never wanted to do a sequel in the previous movies I've done until this one. but sadly i don't know why and why Woody would not do sequel's for zombieland ? it's sadly first film got success it would be sad not to see those cast ever again idon't understand what's going with Woody Harrelson in his role he looks like he is having fun, he is enjoying it you can tell he is having a lot fun, if i had a role that i loved and i enjoyed if they ask me to do sequel i would but it depends how sequels are. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg confirmed in February 2010 their return for the second installment of the series, i have no idea how woody changed his mind. in 2011, Jesse Eisenberg said that he was "not sure what's happening" with the sequel but that the writers were working on a script for Zombieland 2. Eisenberg expressed concern that a sequel would no longer be "relevant. but then Woody makes another silly excuses saying i am not a sequels guy ?? but what made him confirm the role then ? if he is not sequel guy but i think he is talking full of crap. in 2017 the script for Zombieland 2 had been completed, director Ruben Fleischer who directed veryfirst zombieland (2009), 30 Minutes or Less witch i didn't like, Gangster Squad that i enjoyed, Venom not so much i didn't hate film i wish tom hardy wasn't star could cast someone else, it should R RATED not much fan of Venom at all. but with this film it's well done better what Ruben did i give him credit for that going back to sequel has to be completed. at least making sequel is much morebetter then making stupid silly TV series that got cancelled what amazon thinks that's going to get huge success, they haven't followed rules, rule number 1 don't try overtake first film, without trying making this sequel to see if it's success. then finally they made this sequel it's time for nut up for shut up to TV series because now this is a kickass hardcore zombie comedy film you will enjoy.the story of this film still follows up 10 years from first (2009) zombieland film and the problem is how in earth are they still having ammo, food, how are they surviving i mean everything takes place after 10 years ago. 4 guys returning cast Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), Wichita (Emma Stone) surviving still killing zombies as usually they have become experts in identifying and disposing of various zombies i loved idea in this film witch they went to living in the abandoned White Houseand really loved costume limo president limo with a minigun at top sick idea that's perfect for a zombie Apocalypse, after Colmubus wanted to marry Wichita is because they have been in relationship in 10 years ago so he is ready to get married with Wichita so she refused she said no i am not ready. now since little rock is grown up she hope she can find a guy to have boyfriend to have family together. but Tallahassee refuse what little rock wants. so the next morning Tallahassee finds a letter just like first film when little rock and Wichita leaves them behind is because Tallahassee still treats her like a child, and Wichita's fear she is too attached to Columbus. so they go out their tosearch for them and theirs pretty girl Madison (Zoey Deutch) known for Vampire Academy, dirty grandpa, good kids, why him ?, Before I Fall. what happened Madison has survived alone for years inside the freezer of Pinkberry
but she quickly falls in love with Columbus, Columbus expect it to have sex all because that he thought Wichita was not coming back anymore. so next day Wichita got upset she didn't care at all, Madison is a dumb blonde not a strong female character like Wichita but at least she was funny and clumsy but in a funny way she wasn't very annoying a little but she wasn't annoying as hell in film. you have rest of another supporting cast like Nevada (Rosario Dawson)known for sin city, Netflix marvel shows, she is in every movies you seen her in she did fine in movie, (Luke Wilson) Albuquerque he is like another version type look like Tallahassee with redneck look and accent and so as Flagstaff, Albuquerque's partner it's like those 4 of guys are who shares similarities with Columbus Tallahassee. i liked how Tallahassee is in love with Nevada they have great love chemistry together. I laughed a bit with this film but to be honest,the only time I laughed out loud fully was even before the opening credits during the Columbia Pictures intro with your statue of Liberty. that was something that has never happened in any another movies at all. this is a very surprising sequel of all time lucky enough i thought this was going to be like spoiled sequel like dumb and dumber 2 when that got flop. Funny references to zombie fans of Shaun of the Dead AND The Walking Dead. It was smart to have it come out close to Halloween for this film wish it could come out closeto Halloween. and believe me people this sequel is should not be missed if you didn't see first film in theater, this sequel has hold it very well. it has a lot of blowing up zombies, new action scenes, tons of tons of fun it never stops it always nut up for action, comedy, gore everything you need from first film added to this Zombieland sequel still has "Attitude" and Zoey Deutch Steals The Movie for me because i thought she was funny for threw out movie but she wasn't very annoying she was a bit but still i think her character stole the movie. unexpected, delightful surprise. Playing the dumb blonde is a hard act to do well without being very annoying and too clumsy. Hilarious great blast! Bigger budget, new characters, amazing dialogue, and awesome soundtrack for opening I laughed more and louder than anyone else which to me was so nice I don't remember witch film i have laughed so hard in a long time. Somesuspenseful bits were so great and the surprises were perfect, I won't spoil I will just say I am very satisfied with everything. if people say to me witch is one better i recokin i say they both better because sequel still holds up just like first one because their wasn't sloppy stupid jokes or over top annoying comedy just like TV series witch is awful. don't ever leave the theater after movie ends don't forget to double tap to sit down and watch Bill Murray cameo again witch was funny and at end of credits don't ever leave or turn off film because there's mid credit scene and end of credits. if you didn't leave after mid credits or ending credits you have double tap for that. 10 out 10 i loved this movie this sequel still hold up very well after first film from 10 years ago. i highly recommended it and i hope they don't forever ever again to make zombieland 3 !It's not like the first one but still amazing movieNo complaints this movie is funny from beginning to endThe wait was worth it! It's just as funny as the first.Sure look, it was never going to be as good as the original but it was as close as you're gonna get.
I'll pause now while you do the age old list of sequels that were better. Once you get to Godfather II and maybe John Wick you're back here.
Seeing as I mention John Wick, this film takes the same transport of a continuing the story. In essence it's just one longer film with a 10 year intermission.
It has everything a zombie comedy flick needs.
Hats off to the fact that they doffed their own hats to Shaun of the Dead.
The walking dead reference was heeee-let it arrive-larious.
Also the T2 comments very clever.
It is brilliant!! Simples. If you loved the first one then you will love this.
If I say anymore i'm Borderline spoilers as it is, sure look....
I hope they make a third - fantastico!!!!I absolutely enjoyed myself again with this second film. It was literally the fastest hour and a half of the year watching a movie. It's just pure fun hearing those 4 banter back and forth. I thought Zoey Deutch was hilarious, and the double understudies of Tallahassee and Columbus was also clever and fun. This is just my kind of humor and action and fun.Peter Sellers was Peter Sellers. Steve Martin is Steve Martin. In the same way, Steve Martin's Inspector Jacques Clouseau is a totally new creation, as uniquely Martin's as the original was uniquely Sellers'. The essential details are the same: the ridiculous accent, the unique level of incompetence, the tendency to karate-chop the air on reflex. But instead of trying to emulate Sellers, Martin fills out the character with his unique brand of goofiness. By the end of the movie, I had totally accepted Steve Martin as the new Inspector Clouseau, never once trying to compare him to Peter Sellers.The film starts out with narration by Kevin Kline as Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom's character in the older films). The narration contains a few groan-worthy clichés but only exists long enough to set up the plot. Kevin Kline sometimes struggles to keep his French accent straight, but he makes up for it later in the movie with his willingness to be the butt of several gags.The movie then moves to one of its high-points: the credits. An animated version of Steve Martin's Clouseau chases after the famous Pink Panther to a traditional rendition of Henry Mancini's theme. The sequence is not only the cartoon cat's funniest appearance so far (Must be happy to be doing something other than insulation commercials), but it's a treat for fans of the original films willing to indulge. Several moments pay tribute to the animated sequences of the Peter Sellers films, including "A Shot in the Dark." Then the real movie begins. Steve Martin shines as Inspector Clouseau, nailing the ridiculous accent perfectly. It even varies slightly from Sellers'. The plot is that of a conventional murder mystery, a nice change from the muddled plots of the previous movies. It's even possible for the viewer to spot the clues.Steve Martin's Clouseau has been upgraded from mere idiot to idiot savant. He's accident prone, absent minded, and slow on the uptake, but when he's got time to sit down and think it's not hard to believe he's capable of solving the case.Beyonce's character, while important to the plot, actually gets only a small amount of screen time. Her role requires only average acting talent. She may not be the most competent actress, but she is very competent when it comes to giving the camera absolutely smoldering stares.I found myself rooting for Martin to solve the case and get the girl. No, not Beyonce. Emily Mortimer as Dreyfus' scatterbrained secretary. She and Martin have great chemistry, as do Martin and sidekick Jean Reno. There's a real warmth in the relationship between Clouseau and Reno's character. The tired routines that were recycled so many times in the original films are thankfully gone, though there are several subtle nods to those familiar with the older films. While, sadly, the movie never once reaches the level of hilarity the originals did, the laughs are steady, the story flows nicely, and the characters are extremely likable. The movie may or may not appeal to fans of the original movies, but fans of Martin, especially the young ones acquainted with him (as well as director Shaun Levy) from the "Cheaper by the Dozen" movies, will love it.I can't say it's a "great movie" because it probably wasn't. However, I was too busy laughing to notice. I honestly don't remember the last time I've laughed that hard, which is what this type of movie is supposed to be about.It actually has a reasonable plot line, etc. when compared to other slapstick type movies, but that is not what makes it a great movie. This movie is about laughing, pure and simple--if you're looking for more than that, go see something different. If nothing else, just hearing actors that are pretty familiar run around with an (intentionally) ridiculous french accent makes it worthwhile.Well, going in, I really expected that I was going to be be disappointed. Since I am a long time fan of the original Pink Panther movies, I knew it was a tall order to even come close. To my delight, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though I love Peter Seller's portrayal of Clouseau, it didn't stop me from enjoying Steve Martin's take on the role. The chemistry of the cast is good and the storyline moves along in an interesting and entertaining way. Kevin Klein does a good job playing the egocentric Chief Inspector and Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer provide good support. Don't let the jaded critics discourage you from seeing this funny movie. Go and enjoy an evening of light, well-executed silly, comic fun. I really hope they make a sequel!I've been psyched to see this movie for a long time. It seems like it has taken forever to make it to the theater. I was concerned to say the least. Firstly, I am a huge Sellers fan. I have seen every one of his movies that I have been able to get my hands on. I am also a huge Martin fan, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is by far my fav of his, so I had this dread that I would have to choose a favorite Clouseau, much like a child of divorce would be asked to choose the mother or the father. Forget it. Comparasins are unfair and only seek to create bias'. I love both Martin and Sellers in the same role for different reasons. Do not watch this movie and think of Martin as an imitator of Sellers and you will enjoy it all the more. Second. I don't know what the critics are complaining about. The humour of this movie is well thought out with gags constantly being set up and paid off throughout. The critics seem to blast the movie for lack of plot. Who cares that much about plot in comedy? I often get ticked off when "comedies" sacrifice comedy for plot, it's like "Oh God, now they gotta do plot advancement, I'm going to the bathroom." Because do you know what you get if you concentrate too much on plot? You get a drama. That would be the frowning thespian mask. If I'm kept laughing I really don't notice plot. The Marx Brother's Paramount movies come to mind. Duck Soup, Horsefeathers, and the others really didn't have much plot either, but they were hilarious. Honestly, nobody goes to a movie saying "I'm looking to see a movie with a nice sound plot without any holes."? If they do, they probably go alone. No. Most people go saying: "I want to laugh!" "I wan't to cry." "I want to see stuff blow up!" I went to The Pink Panther saying, "I want to laugh." I did. In fact, you know how you feel a little tired from a good comedy because you laughed so much that you got a workout? Well, I'm a little sore. Finally, I end on one small criticising remark. I was disappointed that Clouseau solved the crime with intelligence and observation rather than having it fall into his lap. For me the charm of the character Clouseau in the old movies was the fact that he bumbled and did everything wrong only to end up solving the case. Other than that, I highly recommend The Pink Panther. It's even worth the evening price for a ticket.Peter Seller was the first Clouseau! Martin is the funnier Clouseau! I liked old Pink Panther movies but I loved this One. Just like the older Pink Panther movies there is no nudity or bad words, but still it is very funny. I and my wife were laughing for hours after the movie ended.There are very few movies that are equally funny for the parents and kids. I like Cartoons and I take my kids to watch them, but there are no just plain funny movies that all family can go to. I will take my 4 year old to see it and I think he will love it just as much as I did.to fill, and came away almost scot-clean. Although not quite up to Sellers in the comedic timing department. He is very much his equal in the mangling of whatever language he was trying to speak. I have all of the previous Panther installments in my video library, and treasure them greatly. I always laugh out loud whenever I view them. I believe this installment will bring me the same pleasure. I took my 14 year old daughter, and she as well was rolling in her seat. As was the entire theater we were in. And as always, when a comedic masterpiece has been viewed by the 10-16 year old male audience, you will hear the funniest lines quoted all the way out of the theater. "Ah wood lock to bah uh AM-bourg-air!" Instant Classic!Funniest movie of the year. I'm surprised at all the 1's voted for this movie- I know for a fact the majority of 1's are from people who haven't seen this movie. Don't judge a book by its cover and certainly don't judge a movie by its trailer! The funniest parts were not from the trailer! In fact the movie can be classified as funny non-stop- the excitement of Steve Martin's portrayal has to rank up as one of the most unpredictable and funniest since Jim Carrey's "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." I do hope this movie does good at the box office and has a sequel because I'd love to see Steve Martin as the Inspector again. He was perfect for the part.And I have to say, Hamburgers have an affect on everyone, not just the Inspector. Though, I think not many people have a problem saying it like Clouseau.My Wife and I are BIG FANS of both Peter Sellers and Steve Martin. We had a Great Time and this film will be a great stepping off point for the next Pink Panther series ! Steve Martin is GREAT as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, everyone will find a cast member they will enjoy Beyonce does a great job as the girlfriend of the victim with a heart and shows more depth and craft with each film, Jean Remo (loved him in The Professional and Ronin) does a great job and deserves to return. Kevin Kline did well and there were times if you closed your eyes you almost heard Herbert Lom.Time is short, money can be wasted, and there are few weekends until a film passes forever to Video. This is one worth seeing at the Cinema, you can take you Kids or GrandKids to and not be ashamed; and Peter Sellers would be proud of Steve Martin's writing AND Performance ! Well Done !I went to see The Pink Panther with some trepidation. I had not heard a great deal about this film prior to its release. That's usually not a good thing. Steve Martin's efforts over the past few years have been confined to "feel good" family comedies. That's not an approach that would fit a film needing a good amount of physical comedy wrapped in a sense of absurd irony. And how do you replace Peter Sellers.....? Steve Martin has pulled often something I thought impossible. He has made a very, very funny movie in the tradition of the original Pink Panther without replicating every scene and plot development. It had some familiar moments but things kept getting turned upside down (keep the globe scene in mind!).His speech and mannerisms did not conflict with my memories of Peter Sellers at all and I really learned to appreciate Martin for the genius that he is. I never thought ordering a hamburger could be so funny.The supporting cast is stellar. It is hard to beat Kevin Kline and Jean Reno in any film. Beyonce looked fine, as usual, but it was that secretary that caught my interest. I haven't knowingly seen her in other films but I will make a point to look up her resume - very alluring and refreshing.This film is great for all ages. My son is thirteen and he laughed harder than I did from start to end. The film ran almost two hours but I didn't notice it. This was by far the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time.Having been a fan of the Peter Seller movies, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised. Steve Martin's Clouseau was comic genius, his accent very well done - Jean Reno was very good as his "straightman", very different from other roles I've seen him do. Kline was a good Dreyfuss, but his accent kept faltering, which was disappointing as it was quite good in "French Kiss".Without giving too much away, the cameo appearance was an unexpected surprise....It was good to go to a theater and hear people laughing out loud for a change. Enjoy!This movie is simply funny, it aims to make you laugh and no more. Anyone who dissect the plot and put the acting and screenplay of this film under a microscope is missing the entire point of this movie.This is a comedy, not a documentary or an historical saga, this is plane humor, dumb with a bit of a slapstick taste... The entire situation is fictional of course and that's what so funny about it. I've read some comment about this movie here and the people who wrote these comment are way off, talking like those big-shot movie critics. This is a fun movie to watch with a "stupid" yet hilarious story, simple comedy and a lot of what some people call "toilet humor" (which is always funny) - it's nothing more than pure entertainment and it leaves you with a smile on your face which is never a bad thing, right? I've seen this movie 5 times and I still laugh my heart out! :-DI have seen the Unrated version on DVD together with my family.I was very much suspicious about this movie from the moment when I saw the DVD cover and really wanted to push stop button after the first 5 minutes of the film, especially after seeing absolutely silly makeup :=) Lucky for me, others wanted to continue watching. What followed was 1 1/2 hours of great comedy, some scenes are so hilarious that even after seeing them many times I still laugh again when seeing them.In some way this movie is identical to Soul Plane by being an underdog which is blamed to be racist and full with low level jokes. Perhaps it is, but I still find it very funny.10/10 (Partly because of the IMHO unjustified low total rating this movie has)After seeing the Wayans Brothers in Scary Movie 1 and Scary Movie 2 I had high expectations on this film, not because they are comic geniuses or anything, but because they are one of the few toilet humor actors I can tolerate and even find quite humorous under the right conditions. White Chicks pulled out all the stops, and remains one of my favorite movies to watch till this day.There was just so much hilarious material, that was quite different from some of the other comedies I had recently seen. Yes, the main plot is really unbelievable, but it pays off. All the cast knew what kind of film they were working with and slap it up whenever they can. One of my favorite scenes is in the dressing room, and another is at a restaurant. I will leave it at that for those who have not seen it. This film left me smiling long after it was over, because it started off strong and carried out the whole way through. That's all it really needed to do. I must say that there was nothing wrong with this film at all, and that it was totally funny. It was kind of obvious how when the brothers in the film dressed up to be the sisters they looked nothing like them, but I still thought it was a great underrated comedy!White Chicks is the funnest film i have watched in years. Am i the only one who thought the made up black dudes looked better than the real white chicks. As for all the comments about the film being racist, cant anybody watch a film any more as a film , as a comedy film, and not as a statement of America right now. Remember its a comedy you laugh at funny things on film, you don't watch a comedy film to write a check list of every thing not politically correct about the movie, its a movie to be enjoyed by the masses not by the political correctness police, get a life people. I watch a film to enjoy that film, i watch the terminator and i don't think while I'm watching it, mmmm Arnie cant act, he shouldn't be in this film, lets have Dustin Hoffman play the terminator he can act, cause that would be and is stupid, watch a film to enjoy, thats what they are for.This is just plain fun and will have you laugh until your insides hurt. Marlon and Shawn Wayans go undercover by using disguises in order to infiltrate the rich and uncover something bigger...only their seniors have no idea whats happening....This film is hilarious from start to finish; the laughs just keep coming; you won't be able to stop for a minute to catch your breath. Terry Crew is perfect for his role, his lines are funny and his physique is amazing... While the other characters are just as good, (far too many to name). It does have an element of Bad Boys but it works.Some critics label this movie as 'stupid'; I think its a film were you can just sit back and laugh out loud, it isn't the greatest plot but thats not what this aims to do...its not an Oscar nomination, its purpose is to make the audience laugh and enjoy themselves and thats what it does with perfect precision.Americans are some of the most uptight folks on the planet. To the folks who think this movie is anything but funny, well you are hopeless.PC in your case means pitifully cramped. Humor, like beauty, is unique to each person. But the Wayans seem to be able to dish out equal portions of playful jabs and tongue-in-cheek which appeals to me.A look at the Hilton sisters and their lifestyle gives more than enough fodder to make something really funny, and it is in this movie.If you want intellectualism, go elsewhere. This is just smartly funny.This is one of my favorite comedies. It's an excellent movie. I even saw it twice and I laughed a lot. I totally understand why many love this movie, but some really think it's a crap. If you want to see a serious comedy, you won't like this one because it's very absurd. I mean how can two black guys transform into two white chicks and nobody sees the difference. The plot is very unreal, something you won't see in the real life, but if you pass over this things you'll see one of the best comedies. The acting is great, the plot is very entertaining so I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh a lot and enjoy a great comedy.this film had me laughing from the preview to the credits. it is a prefect movie to watch when you just broke up with your boyfriend/girlfriend and lost your dog. You will be smiling in no time. The plot is totally unrealistic but that just adds to the funny of the film. Anyone who says this movie was not funny must have no sense of humor at all because everything out this movie was funny. I thought my stomach was about to explode i was laughing. The fact that they looked nothing like the actual girls makes it even more hilarious. Actually when i seen this movie my grandfather had just died and i couldn't help but laugh when i saw this film. Funny! i cant find any other way to describe it. Good job WayansDirected by Wayans - preformed by Wayans -- Of course this is going to be an off beat movie - but holy cow, this movie is hilarious. One of my favorites. I will not give anything a way, but this whole movie makes my wife and my self laugh every time and is very quotable. "Yo' Hold my Poodle"I saw the movie 10 times and it remains my personal third favorite movie of all time. It's full of laughter and fun. Exactly what we need in movies. To the Wayans, keep up the great work. I love them in Scary Movies. They have certainly done wonders with movies. In these days when we all are trying to get things that are considered offensive out of our movies, gotta ask..how can they get away with it? White Chicks remains very offensive because of one major thing. If it is illegal for whites to go in black face, how is it legal for blacks to go in white face? But I would have to say this, as long as it is a movie like "White Chicks" Who cares? Keep up the great work and I'll forever be a major fan of the Wayans.Always nice to see another Wayans movie. It comes close to the humor of Monty Python, not yet the absurd and satire, but that is what makes Monty Python so unique. These guys have their own style which has been (and i'm sure it will keep on being) funny as hell. Well, the first scene is hilarious, they should make a movie about those two old geezers. But what made me utterly gasping for air and producing a backache from laughing is the toilet scene. Man, this is even better than dumb & dumber's farting scene. Off course this level of humor is to be found throughout the entire movie. Non-stop jokes about anything and anyone, they don't centralize any specific group, they just make fun about everyone and everything. Their acting is so good, it makes you wonder how some celebrities are where they are now. And the make-up and prostheses are really well done. This is a must-see movie. Brilliant!! Can't wait what will come next from this talented group!White Chicks was a breath of fresh air. It took you away from all the gore and drama of most of the latest films. This movie gave you a real chance to just sit back and laugh! It didn't matter if the plot was right or if all the actors could in deed act. It was what it was-funny!Marlon and Shawn have proved to be great actors in whatever role the chose to take. Maybe this movie was so funny because it was so unexpected. They give a whole new meaning to the word versatile. Talent is truly a gift not a learned skill. I hope they had as much fun making it as I did watching it. Congrad's Mr. Wayans on a job well done! Well that's my opinion anyway!I loved this film ~ all of it ~ from the start to the finish ... I can't say there is one part that I found boring, or not quite as good as the rest of it ... I stayed planted to my chair, as did my children for the duration of the running time ... So that says a lot about a movie itself ... As for the humor stakes ... Think of Deuce Bigalow or something similar, and multiply it by 10 ... It's certainly one of the funniest movies, I've seen in a very long time ... The combination of the Wayans brothers went together so well, and they made the perfect acting team ... I hope they do lots more comedies together, on the same scale as this one ... The entire cast of this movie was awesome, and each character, brought their own little bit of comedy into the movie ... I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, and granted it may have been a little cliché, such as cops/good guy/bad guy, but it went so well with the characters, and they really pulled it off ... It was a whole wealth of great entertainment ... from the bonds of a partnership/friendship to some of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen ... I loved every one of them ... A terrific comedy, well worth watching ... 10/10!!!I have to admit. At first I wasn't too fond of this movie. But after some minutes I started to understand and love it. Maybe it does not appeal to everyone but this movie be actin great 'n shait!! "Move, b1tch!!"I can't figure out why the low rating, I've seen it 3 times and it is one of my absolute favorites among comedies. It has a lot of "ebonics humor" and from time to time it be acting all hilarious! Sure, you'd have to have a sense of humor to appreciate it, and be a bit immature.I guess it is the same guys who put "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" on top250(Sure, the movie is rather good, but what it is doing on #12 beats me...) who turned this movie down, I do mean to offend anyone.Laughs - in fact, loud guffaws - are guaranteed for anyone who watches this comedy. A good number of comedies are not funny at all; I would barely even smile. But this one really made me laugh. The whole premise is already quite silly, and you wonder why the "white chicks" could ever be mistaken for the women they're masquerading. (That's the whole joke.)The Wayan brothers were certainly hamming it up in this one. Also, some of the situations actually mirror real life, but this being a comedy, things get exaggerated. Like how the thin lady became a psycho in the dressing room and how one of the "white chicks" was made to squeeze into clothes that were too small.I would recommend anyone to show this movie to people they know who are dead-serious; would they, at least, chuckle? I imagine anyone in a bad mood would have their spirits lifted after watching this rib-tickling gem.Love this movie! Know the lines by heart! One of the best movies I know!Love IT. I have seen IT maybe 6 times or so! Cud see it again and again!The look of the movie was pretty polished. The sets and costumes were good.When I first saw the preview I thought, "no way am I seeing this movie." Then bought the video (at my teenager's insistence). And, I found the movie so silly, it made me laugh! Some people have a problem with the Wayans brothers in drag playing white women. But, what about Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor? Richard put Gene's character in black face (in one of their movies) in a big hat with a radio (boom box) to his ear. And, then he proceeded to show Gene's character how to act "black." It was perfectly ridiculous, and hilarious! White Chicks (2004) is a spoof, loaded with satire, and movie does not take itself seriously. If you liked the "Scary Movies," you'll like White Chicks (2004).I have probably seen this movie at least 30 times. Every single time it is still fresh and funny. Every single time I laugh out loud the entire movie and recite my favorite lines along with the Wayans Brothers. Some gems include: Easy White Chocolate, Negro Please, OK Schwartzenegro, Making my way downtown, Ooops she did it again, Your momma is so old when she breast feeds it looks like this (dust).... RIOT!!! I miss the Wayans and hope they come out with another movie which is up to par with White Chicks. How there was no sequel is a mystery to me.Physical comedy and timing in this movie are excellent with every character having their place while being memorable.Start to finish - Awesome.Such a bad rating. 5.5 only? I give it a 10 because it made my laugh so much. It is really great and funny, good for relaxing. I recommend it to everyone who likes comedy movies. These brothers are amazing. I've watched it so many times and it never gets boring! And I've learned so many lines by heart. Enjoy the movie!I Really love old fashion comedy movies. This movie is a great example.Never gets old no matter how many times i seen it way too funny.One of my favourite comedies ever, it's one of those ones where you can return to when you're feeling a bit down and it will make you happy. It's just non-stop laughs from beginning to end, and if you're looking for a profound or intelligent movie then why would you watch a movie called "White Chicks"? I've seen many negative reviews on here branding it "racist" or "misogynistic" well, maybe it is but it's definitely not offensive because it's so over the top how could you possibly be offended by it? Personally, I don't see the film as "racist" or "misogynistic" I feel that it's making fun of rich, elitist girls who only care about money and their image i.e. people that deserve to be made fun of. The only bit that I didn't find funny was the toilet humour, but that only lasts a short time and some will find it funny. So if you are not too uptight and want non-stop laughs then get this on DVD.geeze.... What can i say ? it's absolutely great humor.. or first-class comedy. Lattrell makes me laugh all the way, esp. when he said : "Cash.." or "perhaps salad?" hahaa.. and i can't stop laughn' (that on the dance floor!) hwahaa.. (great performance Terry!) -i think you should be got an Oscar for that!. i've seen thiz movie for seven times ! .... ........... ...... ........... ..... ....... ....... ...... ............. .... ....... ......... ......... ......... .... .... ...... ......... ........ .............. ........ ..... ..... ..-thanks to the Wayans Brothers .. Shawn and Marlon are dynamic duo ..... Keep Brilliant !!Honestly I never usually write reviews but for this movie i had to, it is a GREAT movie! Full of comedy, laughter, entertainment, crime, drama. I did have high hopes for this movie and i was even more impressed when i watched it. This movie is one of my favourites i really wished they made a second/third one i would rush to the cinemas to watch it. I highly recommend this movie to watch!I loved this film. It's funny and creative. Kept my daughter (9.5) captivated. She just had to call Grandma afterward to tell her all about it.I watched this movie on June 30th, Amazon Prime Member. My kids and myself. Enjoyed this movie. A very cute summer movie. I believe this movie is just for kids and adults! Kids humor were they understand. I heard so many kids laughter and engaged to the movie. Not even a cry, not even loud remarks or playing with some sort of toy/phone. I will be back to watch this on the 14th of July!. It's a good movie for the whole family. Bleh Bleh Bleh!Hotel Transylvania is not one of my favorite animated sagas and the first two were funny and entertaining, but completely average. And my expectations for this one weren't too high.But then I realized that I started laughing hard within the first 5 minutes of it, and I was more surprised every minute of how good it was. The characters are lovely and the script is very well done and heart-warming, and it keeps you laughing all the time.I never thought I would enjoy this movie so much. I highly recommend it to watch it with your family and kids, and if you're an adult you'll love it as well. Totally worth of your time.Enjoy!10/10The monsters are back. This time the patriarch Count Dracula is seeking love and companionship. He is lonely. After unsuccessful attempt in seeking a partner on the inter web he discovers a love interest in the beautiful Captain of a holiday cruise ship. A love tale of hope and love, this sweet story showcases how life is too short, even if you have eternal life and to live alone in a sea of strangers. I loved it and it made me believe in happily ever after regardless if things work out as planned. Dr Wilson TriviñoThis movie was the best of the franchise. I sincerely readjusted my thoughts of the whole series.A fun and fresh sequel. Hey creators, I noticed the 1985 John Candy's Summer Rental reference in the opening Summer Vacation title! Genuine cool. I hope for a 4th installment!Hotel Transylvania 3 is just awesome!!
Previous ones were great too, but I think this one was even better and funnier:)HT franchise is great 1 I love, 2 no so much, 3 omg great couldnt stop laughing, great music, vanhelsing is great but I did not like his grand grand Dougther.I liked,I want see again, was very funny, dome time I want be Dracula bla bla bla jejejeI didn't see the first 2 Hotel Transylvania movies, but went to see this one on a day off from school with kids. I loved it. It was fun, kept my attention, and entertained the kids and adults. I can't wait to see the first two movies now! I was very pleasantly surprised.This was the best movie ever made. I suggest That everyone must see it twice and then buy all three movies. I know that you will love this oneAs a fan of the previous two I was patiently waiting for the 3rd installment. I went in with relatively low expectations as sequels typically are not as good as their predecessors. This was better than the others in every aspect. The writers did an awesome job by making it entertaining for kids and adults. While the first films elicited a slight chuckle here and there, there were several scenes in this where I was laughing out loud. Also, anyone who has ever been on a cruise can relate to many of the scenes which made it even more enjoyable. I feel it's IMDb rating was preordained without many people seeing it as it's score is absurdly underwhelming. It's worth 10 stars in my book and I highly recommend it.Loved this movie. Even though its targeted to a younger audience. The jokes were so dry that they become amazing.This is better than TH2. The comedy was creative and imaginative, the writing was good quality, the style is appealing, the colours were bright and the music was spot on. A good storyline kept me entertained and would appeal to all ages - as would the humour. A great summer film for the whole family.I took my 7 year old to see this movie. We have watched the first 2 like 100 times each and she just can't get enough of it. When I saw they were making a 3rd one I promised her we would see it when it came out. I was afraid since this was the 3rd movie that it wouldn't be that good. I was wrong! My daughter and I both enjoyed this movie. It's a great family movie that will have both parents and children laughing. We really enjoyed it and I hope they continue to make more Hotel Transylvania movies.The first two Hotel Transylvania movies were great! But I was wondering how they were going to create another one that could possibly be better than the first two. However, within the first five minutes, my kids and I were hysterically laughing!! Hands down, one of our favorites! I would definitely watch it again. For sure.I don't get all the bad reviews. Simple as. Granted, I did feel a bit skeptic when the movie came out, but the storyline and comedy completely pulled me in. I watched this with my younger sister and I have to say it is great for many audiences (I'm 15. She's 5.). If you loved the last 2 or even just one, go and see it. It's fun and harmless.Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is absolutely fantastic in every way. It's more fun, beautiful, hilarious, and better than the 2nd film. I mean I still love the 1st Hotel Transylvania and Hotel Transylvania 2, but Hotel Transylvania 3, it's absolutely more fun for all the monsters to have the best 'Summer Vacation' ever!!! :)Don't miss: 
Hotel Transylvania 
and Hotel Transylvania 2The kids and even my fiancé and I loved this movie! We love all 3 of them films but this one was a fun and different approach than the last 2, which I enjoyed. My 18mo sat through the entire film at the movie theaters without saying a peep. It definitely grabbed his attention. 
All in all, it's an adorable family film!What I really liked about Hotel Transylvania 3 was Mavis. She's cute and she became a mother in the sequel with Dennis. That's why I like her. I laughed at the bleh-bleh-bleh parts."Return of the millennial's: Hello, Generation Z!"Its funny, because there was no movie before it.A musical about and for milennials starring top actors and musicians whom are democratic.I loved the first two as did my daughter but I thought this one was awesome. The music was great, the story was heartwarming and the characters were funny.I absolutely loved the sound design in the movie !! The music was fantastic as well as the artwork and design of the film. I don't tend to like animated movies all that much, but this movie was fantastic and probably one of my favorite animated movies !!I had fun with every little detail of it , I really really like itSo often film critics can fail to comprehend the emmence work required from the story teller in writing to the full scripts acting voicings being brought to life on the screen to captivate and encorage positive interaction in LifeThanks for working to produce a great animation motion picture highlighting Love and Change to learn to make better choices . BravoThere is nothing wrong about this film... there is nothing right about it either. It's just another Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and if you like these (I certainly do), you will like this movie too. If you hate them for a lack of plot or the shallowness of the jokes, you won't. I just know I laughed a numerous amount of times, and I felt good after having watched it.And no, I'm not a stupid guy; I like a good plot, good acting, directing and well-thought-of puns as does the next guy. But there are times when you feel like watching a complicated drama, and there are times when you feel like watching a no-brainer.This is definitely a no-brainer, which will make you feel good from time to time. That's why Adam Sandler makes these movies, and that's why they keep doing so well.They will make you feel good :)This is one of, if not the best piece of any category of media/entertainment I have ever seen. This movie made me laugh almost every minute of the film but some how made me think harder than I ever had to with its hard hitting takes on racism, sexism, and classism. With hilarious scenes like the pool scene, to beautiful cinematography at the water skiing scene. Is strongly recommended to all people, whether your a kid, an adult you can enjoy this movie at its fullest.I think there is something wrong with you "americans"! You really hate Adam Sandler. But why? Here in Europe not in your "full of dreams country", he is really appreciated! And he deserves it! I'm sure that 9out of 10 watched this with a girlfriend, mother, nerd friend... watch it with friends, drink beer, think how you are going to look in 10-20 years and you will find it very funny! And I still think that its USA to blame! For the good people from Europe- watch it! The actors are fine, yes the story is known but not "Adam Sandler known". Bottom line- in USA its not good enough, Europe- a nice relaxing comedy from a well known actor.Great one-liner thorughout the movie, it was like stand-up comics delivery. Always feel affection for the entire cast, Sandler, James, Rock, Spades and yes.. even Schneider. Can't wait for Grown Ups 3!i don't know about the rest of the people who reviewed this movie, but it was hilarious! it was a good old' family comedy. the boys Adam, Kevin, Chris, David and rob to a great job bringing back the old days of summer. when kids used to go outside from morning to night to play; and not sit inside glued to a screen or any sort. i didn't try to predict anything, i just say back and watched the movie.its a 10 our of 10 for me simply because it was entertaining from beginning to end. even the stupid parts; like the night time water bottle scene. its was stupid and pointless, but funny. and then it rolls into another funny scene. the movie has heart, i'm telling you, you should go see it despite what other people say; they probably hold their phones like they're drinking tea, little finger up. don't over look this movie. it's a great family movie, has constant jokes and gags. and we should all take something away from it, nostalgia. i know i miss those days. take this movie for what it is at face value. its just a bunch of men being...well, boys.Now Grown-Ups is an excellent movie to teenagers. The movie is centered around them. Hot girls, funny jokes, sports, etc. Anyways I've read a couple comments and the people who hate on this movie are probably out of their teen years. My opinion is Grown-Ups is a very funny comedy. Now sure it doesn't have a plot but that doesn't make it stop from being a good movie. Plus the PG-13 rating is perfect because little kids and teenagers can watch it.I also have to ask why do people complain and complain? Multiple reviews comment about the marriages in the movie. No way someone that fat can get someone that hot! Really? It's a movie. I mean look at Avatar? No one says "Hey, Pandora isn't real! Let's hate on it!" Movies don't need to be realistic they just need to appeal to people. It certainly appeals to me and to many other people.That's what I think people can argue with me but that's their opinion.What's the most important thing you want out of a comedy? You want to get a good laugh out of it. It's not important if the story isn't complicated and doesn't contain a lot of action. No, for me a good comedy means a bunch of tacky jokes, some unfortunate accidents and a happy end. Kind of like National Lampoons, but instead of Chevy Chase, here's Adam Sandler with his buddies and family having a nice weekend with each other and the rest you should see for yourselves. I thought this movie is so worth seeing and I almost didn't because of the bad reviews it got. I'm very glad I saw it anyway, because it really made me want to give my review and here it is; I think this movie represents an all American feel good movie with lots of hilarious moments and is very laid back. Two thumbs up!OK...I just saw the movie and i loved it.. If you're expecting an old Adam sandler movie then chances are you won't like it.. Its about a bunch of grown up friends who get together at a cabin and their adventures for a couple of days... And it is hilarious...You don't laugh throughout the movie, but you are likely to have like a series of laughs... The humor is very real humor.. not the overtly silly retarded comedy of old sandler movies.Don't get me wrong i like that kind of humor too...They take shots at each other, reminisce about the past, tries to relive their childhood games...Steve Buscemi is hilarious..God bless him...A lot of people said there isn't any story..And there isn't...Like i said this is very real humor, its like we are seeing a few of their moments over a period of 2-3 days... I instantly related to them because thats what me and my friends do sometimes...I really loved this movie..relax,grab a beer,have some friends come over and give it a watch...I do not understand why it is 6 we really enjoyed and watched it again very funny. one of the best of adam sandler moviesFor the beautiful bond of friendship! Watch it to cheer yourself, laughters and deep smiles.Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "Sex Scenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade's disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named "Deadpool", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it's done! It's the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don't give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you've been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He's now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let's face it, that ain't DEADPOOL's style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved "Zombieland" back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it's like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that's exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it's music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he'll talk to you the audience. But what's even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he's in and the universe that you're in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I'm glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it's simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it's like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock 'em sock 'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can't be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since "Green Lantern" and whatever the hell that was in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he's really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa well, let's just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, 'Why can't my girlfriend be more like that!' If you're looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you're looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it.I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too, and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool? Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago. Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it. Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for that alone.I can't believe this didn't win either of the 2 golden globes years back! Such a wonderful theater experience and still very entertaining. Exactly what Deadpool should be a foul mouthed, buff, stunt galore, and hilarious. The cinematography along with the style is magnificent; a lovable gem that deserves so much credit! I can't praise this movie enough, I like how well written it is too.Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, "an avocado had sex with an older avocado". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent ("count the bullets" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as "that British villain" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10I enjoyed every minute in this movie. This will become an instant classic and one of the best movies Marvel has made. From the first scene i was blown away. If you are 12 or older i highly recommend you watch this movie. I can't say more without spoiling the movie so go see it. I was at the cinema with my girlfriend and she is not a Deadpool fan, but after she saw the movie she wanted to buy the Deadpool comics to learn more about him. This is how good the movie was. The first 15- 20 minutes of the movie are probably the best intro to a movie i have ever seen. And here is a tip. Stay after the ending credits. You will not regret it.Ryan Reynolds is the embodiment of the Deadpool character. He did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is. In my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character. Before watching the movie, I was a bit afraid the story of Wade would slowdown the roller-coaster ride, bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie. Not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the Marvel universe was pulled into the story, but I'm not completely sure of it :). The fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very Deadpool.It's Brutal, It's funny, It's Action in it. I love this Movie. It's one of these Movies i never get tired ofThis movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular.Sometimes a movie's very first scene perfectly sets the tone – and serves notice that you're about to have a unique cinematic experience. Allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' "Deadpool" (R, 1:48). We see a single moment frozen in time – the inside of an SUV as it flips over on a busy highway. In slow motion, the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious (and humorous) positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash. As we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage, the only sound we hear is Juice Newton's 1981 hit song "Angel of the Morning". We also see the movie's opening credits – not names, but tongue-in-cheek references to the actors and filmmakers, employing phrases like "The British Villain", "The Comic Relief" and "Overpaid Hack". Wild. Irreverently funny. Unique.Before he was the violent, wise-cracking anti-superhero Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was just a violent, wise-cracking neighborhood tough guy for hire. (He's the kind of person you'd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you – or just leave you alone.) Wade seems to have only one friend, a bartender called Weasel (T.J. Miller) until Wade meets hooker/waitress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They each have an acerbic wit, an irreverent personality and a messy life. In other words, they're perfect together. They fall in love, start living together and even discuss marriage. It seems like they're each as happy as they've ever been before until the other shoe drops. Wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer, which has taken hold in different parts of his body.A mysterious "recruiter" meets Wade at Weasel's bar and tells Wade that he can cure that cancer – and make him better than he was before. With no other options, Wade enters a secretive and ominous-looking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudo-medical treatments designed to force his body to mutate. Wade emerges cancer-free, and with impressive strength and athletic abilities, as well as the ability to rapidly self-heal, but also with a face which Weasel says looks like "a topographical map of Utah" among other things. To hide his disfigurement, Wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name Deadpool, after the dead pool that Weasel runs for the patrons at his bar.Deadpool may look and move like a superhero, but the man behind the mask rejects that label. He's an anti-hero on a mission. Deadpool is out to find Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man who, along with his assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano), ruined Wade's good looks – and force Ajax to fix what he messed up. With a decidedly anti-superhero attitude, Deadpool (gruesomely) kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him. Two other mutants (a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body) try to get Deadpool to join them and their fellow X-Men. No dice. Deadpool is a solo act – only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with Vanessa and (besides Weasel) only associating with his old lady roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams)."Deadpool" is not your father's superhero movie (or your son's, for that matter). As much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick, the whole R-rated anti-hero/superhero thing is a refreshing change of pace. The script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) is witty, hilariously self-referential, and the conceit of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well. Under the guidance of visual effects guy – turned director (FIRST TIME feature director - !) Tim Miller, we get some great action sequences and visuals (despite the production's incredible shrinking budget), a story that's fairly simple and easy to follow (despite its non-linear presentation) and a main character that's faithful to the source material.Although you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film, it's actually perfectly cast. Skrein and Carano make a great villain and henchman (henchwoman), respectively, Miller is a terrific weasley friend, it's wonderful to see Uggams back on screen (especially since I kinda thought she had died) and Brianna Hildebrand (as Negasonic Teenage Warhead) as well as Stefan Kapičić / Andre Tricoteux / Greg LaSalle (who, respectively, provided the voice, body motion-capture performance and facial motion-capture performance for Colossus) brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more. Maybe most surprising of all, Baccarin made me forget her many famous well-dressed small-screen characters, like the stressed-out former POW's wife in "Homeland" and the devious otherworldly leader, Anna, in "V". Then, of course, there's our star. Reynolds plays his character like a combination of Bill Murray (in "Ghostbusters" or "Groundhog Day"), Daniel Craig (in "Casino Royale") and Bruce Willis (not as the incredulous superhero in "Unbreakable", but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic anti-heroes in "Die Hard" and "Hudson Hawk"). That all may sound like kind of a mess, but the sensibilities of those characters joined with Reynold's natural charm make for a winning combination.But don't just take my word for it. Let the data be your guide. This film started breaking box office records (albeit very specific and obscure records) as early as its Thursday night previews and Friday opening day. Still not convinced? Here's an idea – see the movie! Even if you don't like it, at least you'll know what everyone else is talking about. You'll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel, which Reynolds/Deadpool announces in a post-credits scene. Of course, no one can guarantee you'll like "Deadpool". After all, it's "only" a superhero flick and it isn't exactly Oscar material, but I, for one, can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a movie. And, after all, isn't that the point? "A+"When they shut him up in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine", I was outraged! But that movie is what I hoped to get and more. I was laughing in the opening credits... That takes genius... and madness~I suggest that you pay to see it in IMAX, you'll see more blood in bigger details, and with the added bonus of doing a big FU to the people who denied us this juicy pleasure for years!!! Because they thought it wouldn't be profitable, so let's prove them wrong to get more. They thought that people would be too narrow minded and boring to be able to enjoy crazy originality.I know I did~ And many others too, it became an instant classic. I thought that it rated in the best movies released lately, but it was in a list of the best movies of all times!!!I just adore his WTF humor. But the vulgarity might be trying to hide a sensitive heart~ Murderers and w***** can love too, you know!!!Ryan Reynolds, thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life, and the way it should be this time. You're totally awesome, even disfigured.I'm a prude and I totally approve of this f****** movie, even the sex scene was cool for once.slow mo action explosion romance explosion again x men more explosions a deep and intense story followed by more explosions so funny go watch it you won't regret the dirty jokes and explosions will keep you entertained until the end of the 2-hour movie I'd never really paid much attention to Deadpool until now 10 out of 10Back in 2008 (or 2009, who cares?) We got our first glimpse of Deadpool on the big screen. What we got took away everything decent about the character, he is the merc with the mouth, yet his mouth was sewn together! Ryan Reynolds seemed perfect for the role, how did it all go so wrong? Well now, in 2016 Reynolds returns and we get our first official Deadpool movie. In that we get the world's greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre, and a highly original film that does 100% justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all time!So, here we follow Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into Deadpool, a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal. One problem remains, he is now ugly as sin. We follow Deadpool on a revenge story, as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies. What i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over Wade's life. Deadpool is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to it's source. It is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time. The opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they don't peak your interest right away then I'm afraid you're in the wrong film! I love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around. The supporting cast do amazingly well as well. Colossus and Negasonic TeenageWarhead from the Xmen are just the greatest additions to this film. This is easily the best incarnation of Colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful. Of course, with them on board there are some very funny Xmen jokes to look out for. Morenna Baccarin (did i spell that right?) Is the perfect love interest for Ryan Reynolds. Her character is a lot better than other 2-Dimensional females in comic book films. When she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great. As for villains, Ed Skerin was so unlikeable, which is great because with a character like Deadpool it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of Angel Dust was also a good decision. And lastly, TJ Miller acts almost as Wade's second in command, Weasel. He stole quite a few scenes, but in the end this is Ryan Reynold's show and nobody tries to take that from him.So do i recommend? Hell yeah i do! Its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to it's awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for Deadpool. Stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise. Definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way, there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch, but they don't last long. Anyway, go and support Deadpool because we need more superhero films like this. Now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80's music and eat chimi changas...I am really not a superhero movie fan but watching this, it felt like something completely new and fresh. Extremely enjoyable and funny.
I'm disappointed to see only an 8 on IMDb because it deserves way higher.
I'd give it a 9 but since I think it deserves better overall, I'm giving it a 10zI hope to see him acting with spider-man one day. I think I might be very excitedMy most anticipated movie of the year, I went nuts for it, I had a hard time sleeping because I was too excited.So was all the excitement and marketing worth it? Yes, yes, yes, it's so great, I had so much fun, this movie will be for everyone and has you entertained from start to finish. Wait, not everyone, because it's a hard R. Seriously, anyone under the age of 17 should not by any means see this because it's very violent, has bad language, graphic nudity, drugs, has some "love" scenes and has a lot of overall jokes that kids won't understand.For the ones who don't know who Deadpool is, he is someone from the X-men universe which is made by the comic book company Marvel. If right now you're thinking "so it's a superhero movie and I don't like those" don't worry, it makes fun of superhero movies a lot.The story is about a man called Wade Wilson who is a mercenary that get's diagnosed with cancer one day. The only way he can survive is to make him a mutant so that his body can fight the cancer. So when he does become Deadpool he appears to have made an enemy that goes after his girlfriend.That's what you need to know about the movie, now everything that is awesome about this movie. First off the genre, it is everything, seriously it has aspects from every genre. It has a love story that actually makes a lot of sense so it has romance. It also is a superhero movie because it involves the X-men but it also makes fun of all the superhero movies.So it is also a satire, but not only a satire on superhero movies but also on pop-culture today and on movies in general. It's also definitely a comedy, I laughed so hard during this movie that I had issues catching my breath for laughing uncontrollably. The jokes are varying and everything in it is so funny.It also of course is an action movie because the action in it is very good and very violent and this movie definitely couldn't be done without an R-rating. It also has some horror things in it, when Wade is made into Deadpool it's actually horrifying.Then I will say that every actor portraying a character in the movie works perfectly, Ryan Reynolds is born to be Deadpool. He was exactly what the character of Deadpool should be: A kid in a man's body that breaks the 4th wall and has fun throughout the entire movie.Also his girlfriend works perfectly and their relation is totally weird but believable. The villain Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, is a very good villain and you understand why Deadpool wants to get him. And in my personal opinion, this is by far the best portrayal of Colossus in a movie to date. Then we have TJ Miller as the best friend of Wade who is hilarious and even the taxi-driver Dopinder who they also managed to make funny.I have one single issue with the movie and that's that it is too short. The movie was so brilliantly put together that when they got to the 3rd act of the movie I thought: "it's almost over but I don't want it to". Luckily there has already been an announcement for a sequel, so I'm happy. Also if you haven't seen it yet, stay in the theater to the end of the credits because there is a great end-credit scene.Deadpool is the most entertaining experience in a movie theater I had in a very long time and it's a brilliant movie, go see it if you haven't already. Definitely a 10/10 which is my 10th actual 10/10 I ever gave.2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies, yet the only one I was really interested in is this one. Seriously I am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots, excessive and gratuitous use of CGI, awful pacing, and even being unfaithful to the comics.Speaking of unfaithful, I was so looking forward to seeing Wade Wilson in the 2009 Wolverine movie, even more when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing him. That's perfect! Van Wilder can quip like no tomorrow so he's perfect for playing the Merc with the Mouth... sewn shut. Yea great job there Fox. And great job with Fant4stic too...Then the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like DO THAT! And the coke snorting corporates at Fox listened. From the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappoint.This movie was so much fun. They really got the character so right because I was laughing non-stop. This was a really funny movie. Deadpool is one of the very few characters in the Marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware. And the movie really got because it is rife with meta-humour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever. And yes we see him breaking the fourth wall, making pop culture references, and slicing up bad guys. The film is not tame. The humour is nowhere near South Park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to PC culture. The action scenes are also a lot of fun. From the sword fighting, to the shooting, to the acrobatics, they were all filmed really well. It delivers on the violence too, which is cartoonish enough but it doesn't go too much into Blade territory. Although with Wade Wilson's face, in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune. Guess they wanted to use Ryan Reynolds as much as they could.The story is quite simple here. Its a love and revenge story. It is well paced though as it is told in a non-linear style. It somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short. There are some plot holes, but you really don't care because of how fun the movie is.This movie is so refreshing. I thought I was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt, you can have so much fun with him or her. Honestly I really don't care about any of the upcoming Avengers films or this new X-Men film or the Superman vs Batman film because they're all so formulaic. Deadpool brought us something different and it was awesome, like a chimichanga.From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes Deadpool. Yeah Deadpool, that sounds like a *beep* franchise. Absolutely amazing movie by Marvel. Now I can say that I forgive Marvel for messing Avengers 2. Deadpool is the first "R- Rated" movie that I have ever seen in cinema and I enjoyed every second of it, thanks to the censor board that they didn't ban it in our country otherwise my weekend would've been ruined if I hadn't got to watch Deadpool. Deadpool is not a typical superhero movie, so even if you don't like to watch superhero movies, you will love Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was a perfect choice for Deadpool who did a fantastic job in his role and the script was very original, funny and well written. It has multiple elements including action, comedy, romance and most of all emotions. Moreover, this is not just a superhero movie, this is a love story that's why it's being released on Valentine's day. So, go on see it, enjoy it and have a laugh later. Especially for single people who do not have any date on V's day, Deadpool is the best gift that they will ever get *haha*. No doubt it is and will be one of the best movies ever produced by Marvel along with The Avengers. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who is allowed to watch it in their jurisdiction. Have a great weekend!I heard so much hype, was sure it would not live up... better. Better than the hype. JFC. I want all movies forever to be as good as this. Ryan Reynolds has increased 90,000 times in my estimation. From the opening credits to... the howl thing. Amazing. Maybe00MAYBE--sags a touch at the end, gets a little conventional. But this movie is so ^*^*&&^% good, you forgive it.Yes, you read that right... Hi, I'm Review Pool, and want to give the casual Marvel enthusiast or the curious party wanting to see this movie the skinny. Here's the thing, and forgive me for being so blunt, but if you do not know this character, you will not understand this movie. You probably won't like it. It'll confuse you more than how the Kardashians are still famous. More than how the 'Real Housewives' are still a thing, and even more than how the Danish word for 'poop' (bae) became an endearing term for your boo. But I digress... Yes, this movie was created for the fans. The 4th wall breaking, wise-cracking, ultra-violent, and gratuitous dirty mind that makes up this character is completely embodied throughout this film. That being said, do not take your kids! If they are under the age of sixteen and haven't been exposed to the internet, or the characteristics previously mentioned, you will have CPS called on you. Doesn't matter how much they whine, how much they beg, do not EVER, EVER, feed them after midnight...oh wait... This movie takes a lot of elements through Deadpool's comic history, and blends them I together as best as a 1hr and 40 min movie could. Even for a fan of the character since '92, can appreciate the things that were overlooked and condensed for the sake that it graced the big screen at all. I enjoyed the elements from some of the smaller issue Deadpool comics that were thrown in there (Pizza boy scene, thank you RR, I recognized it immediately). Yes, it was raunchy. Yes, it was violent. Yes, it was full of f-bombs! But that's what makes this character so wonderful, is that it doesn't stick to the traditional do-gooder rhetoric. And fans will not be disappointed with the Stan Lee cameo...pay attention to everything in this movie, including the opening credits. And don't forget to stay through the ending credits...Now I knew I wanted to see this film. Not because I am one of those fanatic, over the top, comic hording maniacs. But just because I am a sucker for the easy to watch super hero movies. My expectations did not exceed the ones I had prior to all of the xmen films or any other film of the same genre for that matter. This last week I had some trouble reaching my goals at work, so to reset my good mood, I asked a friend to go see this film. Without thoroughly reading reviews, I quickly scanned some headlines that already had been written about Deadpool. I seemed promising!I can ensure you with near to definite certainty, this will be my first and my last review. But this film deserves every misspelled, every typo and every sentence which in English does not fully cover that what I am trying to express to you on how much I liked this Film.Deadpool does not have loose ends, does not have moments which leave you wondering afterwards about how do they not make sense. Some people may find the abundance of humour confusing in a superhero movie, but hey, how would you be if nothing could kill you?I enjoyed every joke, every one liner, every reference to other movies. The entire audience in the cinema couldn't stop laughing. And for your information, the Dutch are the hardest audience to entertain. Now the only thing I am not sure off is that female viewers may go home with severe lack of self esteem due to the overload of extreme good looking women (and the occasional nudity.....skip that....loads of T&A)I am also worried about milking Deadpool. The sequel will never be able to top the first. So unless the studio is confident they are able to make something better, my advice would be; please don't bother. Let this one become an icon. This film raised the bar and set the standard for films to come in this genre.If I was asked to say something about this film in one sentence than it would be this; Too much of anything is never a good thing, until deadpool was made...20 century fox finally did something right. They not only gave a great character justice, but they casted possibly the best person to play him. Ryan Reynolds did to Deadpool what peanut butter did to jelly. Yeah!! That good! The movie is made for the fans the comic book, but more importantly its made with one thing in mind. Don't hold any punches, literally & figuratively. Now you may not get all the comic book jokes or puns, but you will get satisfied with not only the humor, but great action and effects. I have waited along time for one of the X-Men movies to do my boy Colossus justice, whoever thought it would be in Deadpool. Date movie, sure (if she likes that kinda of thing), family movie/kids movie... not so much. Deadpool will make waves in this industry with it being a lower budget comic book movie that was a hit in my eyes. With a lot of promise for future movies, 20th Century fox, just might have redeemed its self from the fantastic four.....Well maybe not, but this was definitely a step in the right direction.They said it couldn't be done. They said "Deadpool" will never be made and I, as well as others, almost agreed. After his abysmal performance in X-crement Origins: Wimperine, the potential of The Merc With A Mouth, was almost terminated without fanfare. Good ol Wade Wilson just couldn't get a break.Well, after so many trials and tribulations, Deadpool was finally given the green light and lo and behold, he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar, so violent, so crude, yet so refreshingly simple, that it set the bar for R-rated comic book movies; quite possible for years to come. This film proved that violent superheroes...actually...make that anti-heroes can be immensely profitable; judging be the film's juggernaut box-office success. As an origin story, Deadpool is great, showing us a side to the Merc With A Mouth with a violent, vulgar side to the character, but also surprisingly, with human depth; something Origins failed to achieve. Character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold, a very likable and relate-table jerk with a heart of gold.Yes, the action is bloody, yet great with slo-mo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic, but it fits the character very well. But most importantly, is the acting and Ryan Reynolds NAILS it perfectly. I can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect; with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks. The film simply wouldn't work without a hard R rating. Thankfully, the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitas.Props to all involved in Deadpool. It's smart, stylish, and refreshingly original. I'm glad they had the balls to make a R-rated Marvel comic book movie and they achieved it. One of the best films of the year and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. Great film, great cast, great direction. Simply put. Great R-rated comic book movie!!After seeing the trailer a few times and while becoming slightly impatient, we had very high expectations, however Deadpool overtook them. It is a movie for big children, forbidden to children, so do leave your -14 at home :) A very blunt humour, which makes it more realistic, awesome special effects and the general idea that all the cast had lots of fun making it. Ryan Reynolds is at his best, so much better than the Green Lantern, which was not his fault, but this is one of the differences between DC Comics and Marvel Comics. We will go see it again, especially that it is shown on a 170 square meters MacroXe Ultra HD Screen only for a limited period of time.I'm guessing that everybody knows the story of this movie by now, but for those who might not have had the opportunity to see this great movie, it's quite a simple formula. The Miami Dolphins mascot is stolen and by word-of-mouth advertising Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is called into manic action. His job is to find the dolphin and return it before The Miami Dolphins' crucial game.
Jim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. This is surely Carrey's best work, even now. OK, Dumb and Dumber and The Mask are very funny movies too, but this takes the biscuit. Everything Ace does made me laugh, from whipping football player's with a towel to get a ring imprint to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self.
100 laughs per hour, if you have a sense of humour, then this movie is for you!!!
In 1994, a year that gave us Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, Morgan Creek Productions and Warner Bros. Pictures came out with the funniest film of the decade, err, 1994, with the Jim Carrey super-vehicle, ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.
Right off the bat, it is a Jim Carrey showcase: chasing missing albino pigeons, rescuing a pampered shiatsu, and making high speed getaways, this all works because it is Ace Ventura, a hilarious, live-action cartoon character who spouts one-liners like an M-16.
The premise of the film is that the Miami Dolphin's team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin, has been captured and needs to be found in time for the Super Bowl. Ace is hired and the sexy Courtney Cox is made his partner until the dolphin is recovered. With an assortment of funny situations like Ace falling into a great white shark tank (!), a montage of Ace searching for a missing jewel, Ace head banging in a CANNIBAL CORPSE concert, it's all gold, and as you have read, Ace is what drives this film into comedy genius!
It was a busy and successful year for Jim Carrey, as he came out with another pair of comedy blockbusters, the LOOSELY translated Dark Horse comic THE MASK, and his hilarious buddy comedy with Jeff Daniels, DUMB and DUMBER.
Thanks to Tom Shadyac for letting Carrey out of the bag and letting this damn funny Canadian strut his lanky stuff.
It has some offensive, adult-oriented material, but if caught on television, this is nearly perfect family entertainment: as long as you don't mind your kids talking from their a$$es for the next couple months.
We saw "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" right after "The Mask" came out. We could not have possibly predicted how wacky it would be. At the moment when Jim Carrey started butt-talking, my dad shouted out: "Lee, he's crazy!" And believe you me, he really was. Anyone who knows anything about the movie probably knows that Carrey plays the title character, who has to find the Miami Dolphins' mascot. But mostly, the whole movie is an excuse for him to be silly. And of course, the woman who played reporter Melissa (Courtney Cox) went on to play the reporter in the "Scream" trilogy.
Well anyway, Ace Ventura really is a master of disguise, and it's almost hard to believe that after almost ten years of stagnation in comedy, this movie came and changed the way that we think about humor. Hilarious.
I've seen this movie several times and it always makes me laugh which is the whole point. Comedy is very subjective so what everyone finds funny will be different. Some people forget that movies are meant to entertain first and "messages" are extras.
Let it be known that Jim Carrey is a comic madman. He may not be the smartest cat on the stage, but there's no question that his act, especially in "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," is the real deal.
Director Tom Shadyac saw fit to put the Man with the Rubber Face, later The Man on the Moon, in his own starring vehicle with this comedy hit from 1994. I've never laughed so hard in my life; that was from the first time I saw it. I saw "Shaun of the Dead" 10 years after Carrey's vehicle; that was another time when I laughed myself silly.
Sure, the humor is immature from time to time. But that's part of Carrey's act, as the colorful gumshoe of the title, who takes on the case of retrieving the Miami Dolphins' prized mascot, Snowflake, after it's stolen from its tank one night. Of course, as the title would lead you to believe, Ace Ventura is no ordinary detective. "I don't do humans," he asserts to us. His specialty is pets. It's hard out there for pet detectives, since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously, except Ace, that is. So when he gets the call for duty, he's all over the case.
His investigation pairs him with Melissa Robinson ("Friends" Courteney Cox), and the two uncover some startling details about the Miami team's history, and one of its most controversial players, who missed the field goal kick at the 1984 Super Bowl that would have won the game and blames Dan Marino for the whole thing. That player hasn't been seen since. Meanwhile, Ace runs afoul of Miami police department lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who seriously needs to take a chill pill and is hiding something more than just a gun under her skirt.
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is a comic tour de force. Of course Carrey has done plenty of better things since this flick, but for commercial purposes, so let's just leave that in the future. Ace Ventura is something that only he could have done, and made it work. Sure his methods are "unusual," but hey, he gets the job done.
I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny.
It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much.
The first time viewing this movie it was turned off 2-3 minutes into it and put back on the shelf.
Two days later, a guest came over and wanted to watch it. I was laughing and asking who is this guy? Aaaaaaaalllrighty Then! is such a catch phrase.
Having no idea who Jim Carey was at the time this is just comic gold. Easy 10 stars.
Not sure while my first viewing was a total rejection, but falling off the couch funny it was for the second viewing and the few 100 times afterwards.
Super funny, great detective story and very entertaining
Jim Carrey plays a mental patient struggling to find love and it is a masterpiece.
This will ways be one of my all time favorites and most quoted movies. I've watched it more times than I can count. It's hilarious!!Personally, I think Talladega Nights is the funniest movie Will Ferrell has ever done so pretty much everything since then has been a slight disappointment (Blades Of Glory, Semi-Pro) and honestly, the first time I watched Stepbrothers I was a little disappointed.But a few months later I popped it in and watched it again and for some reason it was just really funny to me the second time around. It completely grew on me. I think the plot is hilarious, two guys in their 40's still never growing up and still living at home. And I can't think of any better comedy team than Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly to play these parts.I'm probably going to watch this again tonight. It just gets better every time.I liked Ferrel & Reilly as the racing team in "Talladega Nights" but this was even better. The physical comedy was outstanding and the acting itself was pitch perfect. Many critics commented on how well they did given what they had to work with, but I think the script was excellent. Some of the lines were brilliant, but you really have to give the actors credit for improvising. After Ferrell revealed his singing talents when he sang "Let's Give 'Em Something to Talk About", when Reilly gushed on and on about how great he was, and then said "I'm not sure, but towards the end I think I saw you turn into a Unicorn", I lost it. I really lost it when Ferrell's brother & his family were singing in the car "Sweet Child of Mine". It was a real classic.Hell, I think I'll buy this when it comes out on DVD. I can't say that for many comedies ("Anchor Man" is one).Don't miss this one. It's a scream.This rating is affected by weirdo boomers with no sense of awareness & comedy.Both Will Ferrell & John C Reilley are excpetional in this.. but there are also brilliant performances from co starts. (This kind of comedy never wins awards but the level in range acting they show is superb)11/10 Really funny stuff. Made me laugh a few times lolWill Ferrell has always been known for his stupidly scripted dumb comedies that have made him well known all around. Earlier this year he came out with Semi Pro, which wasn't as great as it could've been but still was a decent comedy. But I just recently saw Step Brothers and literally laughed from the opening credits to the end credits. This movie is definitely a hilarious movie. It was really a great choice to team Ferrell with John C. Reilly again.I was strangely surprised that this got an R rating, but it definitely was worth the R rating. Ferrell continues to make the most pointless movies, but somehow I enjoy all of them because he really just makes you laugh uncontrollably for very long periods of time. I definitely recommend that those of you who haven't better go see Step Brothers in theaters. It was well worth it for me.10/10Step Brothers (Bill Forrel and John B. Stacy) is perhaps the greatest work of art since Da Vinci's Monal Lisel.I chose to do my movie review on the hilarious comedy step brothers. It got a rating of 54% on rotten tomatoes which means roughly as many people did not enjoy this movie the same amount enjoyed it. It has many well known actors throughout the film including the two main characters, john reilly, and the king of comedy will ferrell, along with many other well known actors, like richard jenkins (father), mary steenburgen (step mother), and adam scott (brother). Although there were many other characters throughout the film these were the main characters throughout the entire film. If i were to give my rating of this film i would give it a 92% because it's an extremely hilarious movie but also has a story behind it but also leaving the 8% space for yes the fact that it is immature but that still doesn't outway the comedy put into this movie.
 
 The plot of the movie first starts off with Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) as two men around the age of 40 with something very common. both very lazy and unemployed men who one who lives with his mom Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and the other with his dad Doback (John C. Reilly). Both with many excuses of why the aren't on there own living their lives. When at a work conference Brennan's mother and Dale's father meet and hit it off very quickly. they decide to get married and move in together. This makes the two boys very upset and turns their relationship into a war rivalry. But throughout this rivalry start to change and they soon realize that they are very similar and become best friends. But not realizing The way Their actions have impacted their newly wedded parents they soon drive them apart forcing them to get a divorce. With their parents getting the divorce they start to blame each other for the cause which drives them to gain this rivalry back again. As time goes on they both get a job and begin to live on their own to only meet once again at the Catalina wine mixer. At this moment we see that the two boys have grown and matured as men and their parents see that. So the ending of this movie is the start of how they get their life back to the way it was, step parents get back together and they get to act like young childish boys again. Although every film has negatives but this particular films positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot. A big factor that makes this film so good is the great comedian actor will Ferrell. We've seen him throughout many comedy movies including talladega nights, anchorman 1 and 2, elf, get hard, and plenty other comedy movies. What I believe makes will Ferrell such a good actor is the fact that he has one job and this is be blatantly hilarious and just weird and do roles that many actors can't fulfill. One of the best scenes in step brothers is right at the beginning when dale (John C. Reilly) and Brennan (will Ferrell) are sitting down at the first family dinner when Brennan starts to slurp is blue juice and dale doesn't appreciate him doing that in his dad's house so he makes a snobby remark to Brennan so of course he can't let that slide so he decides to say back to dale, "haha I remember when I had my first beer" (Brennan) but if you know dale he can't just let that slide so he says back, "haha I remember when I fell off my dinosaur" (dale). After dale said this to Brennan he must have been to much for him to handle so he started to become emotional and began to cry. We seem really stuck out to me on the comedy side because it's one of the first scenes in the movie and it really brings you into the comedy that you will be seeing in this film. Although this Film has nothing but positives reviews from me every film has negatives. What I can see That's a negative in this film is the immature that goes on, I mean the whole storyline is about 2 forty year old men who live with their parents at home. Another thing would be is this film is definitely not for children it's a film strictly for adults and kids under the age of fourteen should not watch this movie. In conclusion step brothers overdues funny it blows it out of the water and how funny it is. I'd consider this one of my top movies to watch with buddies or even by myself Director Adam McKay really out does himself on this one. But without will Ferrell and John Reilly would this film meets the standards it did? Who knows but overall this films in my books get s 92% rating.I Just got back from the midnight showing of Step Brothers. It is freaking HILARIOUS. I seriously laughed so hard that I almost passed out during the part will Farrel sings for his "step brother". Not a quiet moment in the theater. I never thought I would find another movie that could get more laughs out of me than Superbad, but this movie definitely did it. Don't even think about passing this up, you'll regret it. The movies contains some male and female nudity so use discretion when deciding to bring a younger audience. Phenomenal movie! Will Farrel brings the performance of a lifetime with co-star John C. Reilly.This has to be my all time favourite 'pick me up' film. I find the comedy hilarious.The chemistry between Will Ferrell and John C Reilly is remarkable. I think they are both fantastic actors. Regardless of the silly story line and sometimes pointless scenes, this is still an awesome film. Even the pointless scenes are there for a reason - they are funny!!This film made me watch everything Will Ferrell and John Reilly have starred in. I love both of them and when they come together something magical happens!A year will not go by when I won't watch Brennan and Dale. When Will Ferrell sings Por Ti Volare, even Will Ferrell, I still got goosebumps. It was a tremendous moment in comedy history.Boats and hoes!!Just saw the movie and it's one of the best comedy movies of the year, hands down (can't be sure though, i still have to check out Tropic Thunder and Pineapple Express)!! I've never laughed that hard at a movie, i'm still sweating as i'm writing this from all the laughter i made! Easily, it's Ferrell and Reily's best film to date and Kathryn Hahn was amazingly funny and she nearly stole the film away from Ferrell & Reily! The only thing i know, they are cast her in a lot of movie in the future, she's is absolutely hilarious!! The movie indeed has a lot of swearing & sex (not really bad) but that never stopped the movie from being so good, so you don't have worry about that but don't take your kids that are under 14 years old because in my theater, a mom brought her kid (about 7 or 8) and when the movie was over, she started swearing and repeating the words over and over, the mother was very angry and should of been ashamed of herself for that. Will Ferrell and John C. Reily have excellent chemistry and this isn't the last time they will make together for sure, we will see them again, that i'm sure of. They are the best comedic duo since Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. So, if you are a Will Ferrell & John C. Reily fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one and laugh yourself silly or if your not a big fan of them both, again you will laugh from beginning to end. Awesome, crazy & supremely funny movie!!!!I have been lucky enough to see two advanced screenings of Superbad in Burbank. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. When I read the summary, I was a bit skeptical. The "high school comedy" is not exactly my cup of tea. My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!! I have a feeling it is going to go off the charts once the buzz gets around about how hilarious it is.Well, I just got back from the Superbad screening tonight (thanks to the folks at MySpace) and I must say that this is a very special teen movie. It has that same element of transporting you back to your high school days that the original American Pie had. Michael Cera does great as the awkward teenage kid, basically a reprise of his role as George Michael on Arrested Development. But it is Jonah Hill who absolutely rules this movie! He had me laughing from the beginning to the end. His "silly fat-kid" character is the only one in the history of movies that shows what it truly feels like to be the funny fat kid in high school. I should know, I was one! Gosh, I just can't believe how well he portrayed the unmitigated hell that was P.E.! Emma Stone and Martha Maclsaac also give very realistic depictions of teenage girls. None of that fake, over the top nonsense. The most over-the-top character was "McLovin" himself, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who did a great job of having us laugh with him as much as we did at him.All in all, I think that everyone should be sure to watch this movie when it comes later this summer.This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.4 stars out of 4One of the best comedies ever served in m y opinion. The all-too familiar Greg Mottola is the man at work here, and where credit is due I'll award points to the writer s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. However, this film would drop dead on its face without its hilarious cast undoubtedly, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse being the two most unforgettable stars. Michael Cera is the kind of, I suppose, innocent-type guy who is both driven by hormones yet conflicted by almost inhuman genuine-ness and politeness. Not too many laughs coming from his way but when he did, he did so superbly. Bill Hader and Set Rogen were just top notch. I would also like to amend Emma Stone as Jules, who delivered the greatest "what the f*ck?!" in a good while.All these zany and truth be told rather realistic characters were interpreted pretty well and where as the film was insanely funny the character development was right on par with the laughs. That's probably the film's most monumental achievement, seeing as the soundtrack was one I was rather indifferent about (but not one I despised). "Super Bad" is grade A comedy at its finest.I'm not gonna lie; Movie previews / trailers are almost the deciding factor for me, in whether or not I even CONSIDER watching the movie. In other words, I almost didn't watch this movie due to the fact that the trailer looked stupid. I won't make this mistake again after watching this movie.This movie was TOTALLY NOT what I expected. It's funny throughout - from front to back, beginning to end.I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, as well as those who have...Perfect 10!!!Extremely funny movie, and i love the caracters! Spot onSuperbad has been and mostly will be a favourite film of mine if not the best for me.Links to its nostalgia watching this whilst going through school and having these anxious feelings of what's next and feeling a need to "make memories"The film has it all it's wholesome, funny really good cinematography and perfect actors for the role it was wrote by Seth and Evan whilst they're around that age so it comes off very to the viewer it's not some typical project x blue mountain state film. Not too bash these but this is in a completely different league.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a funny slice of life. It's heart touching side bearing film that I will continue to watch and love.And that may seem like a turn off to people (parents in general, but kudos to those who like it) because they don't expect the realism of the characters and their dialog. What people (parents) what to generally see for some odd reason is some High School Musical garbage lifestyle for a teenager which is completely unrealistic.Having said that, a few of the situations do seem unrealistic, but the message of friendship and dealing with life when it doesn't seem to be going as planned is universally understood by all males and surprisingly a lot of cool chicks who can handle the edgy jokes in between.I don't need a whole lot a space to said what I need to say so I'll give you the gist of it. 1. Almost every teen from 16 to 19 (and most guys for that matter) can probably say "That totally happened to me! It's like they know me!" or "I've had this conversation!"2. A punch line at every corner, and the jokes never get old. 3. It actually seems to get funnier and not "That was kind of funny...." 4. Can be watched over and over again. 5. Can be considered this generations Brat Pack, if they keep putting out hit after hit like this. If you don't like constant cussing or sex jokes, then stay away. It's your loss.Realistic portrayal of teenage trials...at last! Succeeds where so many have failed. Excellent cast deliver excellent script. Very funny. Anyone who can't relate to this film has had some very important chunks of their right of passage stolen. The farcical events could easily be real, and are probably based on true events. This film will stand the test of time, I've seen it three times and enjoyed each in same measure. Strict miserable parents should be forced to watch it. They might lighten up a bit! Anyone who doesn't fall half in love with this film cannot be human. A summary? A rare and wonderful film worth buying, keeping, and watching again and again!The funniest movie I have ever seen (this or anchorman). I almost never watch a movie twice. The only exceptions are a couple Power Ranger movies (oh the good days), Hangover, Half Nelson and this one. This had me laughing from start to finish, literally. Everyone in the theater was laughing hysterically and when I rented it on DVD, me and my friends still found it hilarious despite knowing the jokes. This movie will make you instantly fall in love with Mclovin and leave you quoting the movie for days. One word of caution, you might not want to watch it with your parents or kids. Unless your parents are really cool and unless your a really cool parent.I highly recommend this for anyone and everyone. 10/10Its a landmark movie that really helped this style of movie take off.By far the most unexpected movie for me in such a long time. I'm glad I saw this by far the funniest all year. The characters work, they seem real enough, raw, charismatic for both the two lead cast. They did great playing their roles specially through those laugh out loud situations. The plot? damn the plot when there's mclovin and two Mofo's trying to get booze and getting laid by the last girls that would with them.This is one of the best movie's this year a very different outlook on comedy, accurately done to project the stupidic purpose. But hey its all about the laughter and you cant miss this one. Extremely recommended. Even the portrayal of two bestfriends loving each other is awkward as it is hilarious to watch. 10/10 jonah did pull through here.The whole cast was hilarious and I've never laughed so much at a movie. It's absolute classic! Mclovin is one of the funniest character ever made!Superbad shows itself as a simple teen comedy, and it is, but there is a hidden intelligence to the whole thing. Superbad is hilarious, its comedy is greatly written, while its plot remains very straightforward.But Superbad shines in its dialogue, specifically the interactions between Micheal Cera's and Jonah Hill's Characters, they feel like real friends, some of the lines they exchange, although sarcastic and humorous, they are real. Very realistic, which is rare even among some of the greatest movies.Superbad is quite possibly the greatest teen comedy of all time. But underneath its stupid yet hilarious humor is a emotional study of friendship that is carried by the dialogue.I have to admit that I didn't really want to watch this film back in 2007/2008. I remember my brother saying I should watch it and the title of the film didn't really intrigue me but i thought i would give it a go, and glad I did. The film plot is very simple, and some could sat stupid or silly, but i feel this film is good because the plot is simple. I personally have to be in the right mood to watch a film that requires a good amount of concentration and lots of questioning. A simple story is often good. The films jokes are kind of like" Teen humor", but it it done in a way that is funny to all. I also enjoy the fact that they rip into the police/cops, and he mclovin scene in the shop is my favorite scene in the whole of the film. watch it you wont be disappointed.Superbad is a 2007 film that follows 3 friends (Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christoper Mintz-Plasse) on their quest to get alcohol for a party being thrown by Emma Stone's character Jules. Since they are graduating and going off to different colleges, they've made it their goal to get laid at the party before college. It's primarily a comedy but you could argue that it has a few elements of a coming of age film. It's filled with funny moments, relateable situations and memorable dialogue.The humour in this movie is very similar to that of Pineapple Express and This is the End, it's not that dark and a lot more grounded in reality than the other two but the humour is still noticeably similar. One of the funniest scenes in the movie sees Jonah Hills's character Seth consider buying alcohol despite being under 21. He imagines different scenarious that could unfold one of which has the security guard slit is throat with a broken bottle. The humour in the movie stems a lot of the time from relateable situations that are being blown out of proportion. For example, a lot of people would probably have embarassed themselves in front of a crush. However, they probably wouldn't have passed out and head butted them.While there may be a lot of moments in Superbad that are relateable for being Embarassing or Awkward, there are also a few that are relateable in a more positive way. For example, the end of the movie sees Seth and Michael Cera's character Evan saying goodbye to each other after the events of the film, knowing thay they will now be seeing a lot less of each other, which could at first be considered sad but when you think about it, it's something that pretty much everyone goes through, it could then be seen as Reassuring as it shows the audience that it's natural for you to drift apart from people who you thought would be in your life forever.The dialogue and writing in Suoerbad is also great. The two funniest characters in the film are a pair of dimwitted cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader who take Christopher Mintz-Plasse's McLovin under their wing. One of my favourite lines in the film is When Bill Hader's Officer Slater asks McLovin if he's "familiar with Yoda from Attack of the Clones." Equally the dialogue between the main 3 teenagers is just as funny. From the crewd insults to the drunken slurs, everything they say in the film is something you'd expect a 18 year old to say.Superbad's status as a cult comedy future classic is well deserved. While it's yet to see if it will hold up, Superbad is currentlt one of the best, most relateable teen comedies available. I'd put it on the same level as other great teen comedies like the Breakfast Club and Dazed & Confused.This movie is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion and by far one of my favorite movies. The acting of Jonah hill and Michael Cera together always makes a great comedic movie. All of the jokes in the movie are funny for everybody unless your under the age of 12. This movie also has one of the most know scenes in all of Jonah hills movies the mclovin scene. Overall this movie is very funny and i am writing this review because I recommend people to watch it even though most people have already seen it and also I have to write this review for school.SUPERBAD (2007) **** Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Emma Stone, Martha MacIsaac, Aviva, Stacy Edwards, Joe Lo Truglio, Kevin Corrigan, Dawn Morrow, David Krumholtz, Clement Blake, Erica Vittina Phillips, Brooke Dillman. (Dir: Greg Mottola)Hip To Be Square: One of The Year's Funniest Films; Hilarious  I'm "McLovin' It!!" Every generation gets their American GRAFFITI and the MySpace kids get theirs in one of the funniest films of the year, a howlingly hilarious look at a pair of high school senior buddies who face an uncertain future when they will be going to different colleges come fall.The two pals, Seth (Hill, best known for last year's funfest ACCEPTED and this summer's forthcoming KNOCKED UP) and Evan (Cera of the late, great Fox sitcom "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"), have known each other since kindergarten and on the cusp of high school graduation, with summer approaching and the need to hook up with someone before the friends go their separate ways. Evan is headed for Dartmouth (Seth failed to make the cut) with another fair-weathered geeky amigo, Fogell (Mintz-Plasse, a star-making scene stealer, who constantly serves as a source of annoyance for Seth who really wants to score with hottie classmate Jules (Stone, who resembles Lindsay Lohan and sounds like she swallowed Linda Fiorentino, with her husky/sexy vocals), who invites him to her weekend party and asks for a small favor: if he can buy her the liquor needed. Seth has it all planned out with Fogell getting a fake ID to get the alcohol, figuring that if they were both drunk the more likelihood they would have sex and she would simply think that he was a bad mistake considering their conditions. Skeptical Evan meanwhile is pining for his gal pal Becca (MacIsaac) who also invites him to Jules' party, so the trio get together to buy the booze, make the date and have the time of their lives one last time.Naturally things don't' go as planned and to divulge too much would take away the fantastically concocted craziness that ensues but lets just say two slacker cops ("SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"'S Hader and co-screenwriter Rogen, who also serves as a producer with his fellow collaborator ,filmmaker Judd Apatow, inheriting the Harold Ramis/Ivan Reitman throne of smart/dumb vulgar comedies with rip-snorting gusto); an adult party involving illegal substances; some unlikely bonding; and of course the Holy Grail: Jules' party. Rogen, who wrote the script with his childhood chum Evan Goldberg  when both were in high school themselves, basing much of it on their experiences - is on a roll since his debut in the lamented excellent high school sitcom cult classic "FREAKS & GEEKS" and its companion college spin-off "UNDECLARED" , and support work in films like THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN  and the anticipated starring gig in the aforementioned KNOCKED UP - has a talent for the raunch mixed with heart in this hysterical teen comedy that proudly wears its vulgarity as a badge of honor, and the mentoring of collaborator Apatow, have created another smash-hit cult classic in the making that ranks up with its genre forefathers like FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and DAZED AND CONFUSED. Director Mottola (THE DAYTRIPPERS) handles the comedy with great skill and lets his young charges get their ya- yas out (** @ the sneak preview I attended, Rogen, Apatow, Hader and Mottola were there and it was confirmed that the cast were allowed to improvise and it shows) It clearly captures the hellish existence of adolescence, angst, anomie and in general feeling like a loser when a winner is deep inside all of us. And it has a plethora of dick jokes.What more can you ask for? Hill, who suggests the love child of the late Chris Penn and Gene Wilder  the former's raspy voice and the latter's manic likablities  is a truly gifted comic actor  here sporting a Richard Pryor t-shirt and rockin' his Jew'Fro - who finally has a showcase to show just how funny he is and it is genius to have the awkward deadpan of Cera, as the well-meaning and respectful nerd who comes into his own as well.. Sexy newcomers Stone and MacIsaac also hold their own with their likable co-stars. But it is newbie Mintz-Plasse making an audacious film debut (his first acting gig ever!!) who suggests the coolest geek since the aforementioned GRAFFITI'S Charles Martin Smith's "Terry The Toad", as Fogell , AKA , "McLovin'"  the singular moniker he chose for the fake ID, who steals the film with his mouth-breathing stylin' doofus who gets in one crazy situation after another with the police officers, who themselves prove to be just as cluelessly enabling their young charge with one ridiculously insane endeavor after another.Trust me if you need to laugh long and hard from the funky opening credits with a killer soundtrack  from start to finish you will be in spasms of laughter to the point of pee-in- your-pants submission. By all means make sure you see this come August when it will be officially be released. You'll be McLovin' it too!!THE COOLEST AND THE BEST MOVIE EVER I REALLY WANT TO WATCH IT FOR THE 3rd TIME NOWThis is a total classic and I love everything about it. 11 years later wow so crazy but such a great film about high school and the pressures of sex.First of all, any review that uses 'Superbad' in its title in an attempt to put the movie down reveals more about the depth of the review rather than the movie itself.While there is nothing new about a movie that features a bunch of teenage boys obsessing over the opposite sex and ways to get laid, it is unfair to compare Superbad to American Pie, Porky's and the like.The key factor that drives this movie beautifully are the characters. If we didn't know someone like Seth, Even and Fogell at school then that's probably because we were like one of them. Each of the actors superbly portrays the bravado boys use to mask their insecurities over dealing with girls.The humour is plentiful, funny and appropriate and yes, there's plenty of bad language and crudity, but we're talking about a teen movie here, not an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Anyone watching a teen movie who then gets offended by swearing and sex should not be watching that movie in the first place.This movie reminds me of my own days at school decades ago now when us guys simply could not stop using the 'F' word and looking back we must have sounded ridiculous. I can also remember my first day lying about my age not in order to buy alcohol but adult magazines off the top shelf as well as the first alcohol fuelled party that I attended. Superbad brings these memories back vividly.Even though I'm a big fan of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I have to admit that Bueller's character was not only unrealistic and outlandish, but bordering on dislikeable. Watching it recently I found myself rooting for Principal Ed Rooney to give Bueller his comeuppance.Geekily charming, yet annoying and endearing at the same time Fogell 'McLovin' now has to be one of my all time favourite teen characters. The characters of Officer Slater and Officer Michaels only work well because they bounce off the character of McLovin. Seth and Even work well as a teen odd couple and all three lead characters are developed well to the extent that you even end up rooting for all of them. So, all in all a very funny movie, with some very touching moments. If you want to watch a movie that takes you back to your school days, your old friendships and your attempts at trying to pass for 21, this is it.Seth Rogan, talent is all i can say. A cast of talented unknowns, a dynamite script. A damn good time, there are some films that give off no indication as to why they are so loved, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show as an example. Superbad's main card is that it is, strikingly honest in it's comedic situations, it's a film that anyone who was ever a young male, can relate too. Though females may find little humor in this film, men will be in stitches. I can see countless offended viewers that may walk out of this film offended, shocked. It is all an act, it's just too true for them to handle. That policeman may not be entirely perfect, that boys do have penis' and girls do have vagina's. That sex is good, that the moments that the world tells us to forget are the best times of our lives. Enjoy Superbad for it's glorious political incorrectness.Virdict: Bring out the lubricant!!!!Superbad is one of those movies where you laugh out loud the whole way through. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's relationship is hilarious and more importantly so real. Their chemistry drives the film but the supporting actors are equally as brilliant. As someone who just recently graduated high school, I can relate perfectly to the characters and their emotions as well the realness of the dialogue and partying. This movie is better than American Pie, more real than Dazed and Confused, and I can even say funnier than Fast Times. That's saying a lot. I just really can't express how funny this film is. Go see it right now if you haven't. I give it 9.5/10 only because it has about a 10 minute slow period, but the other 105 minutes are the most brilliant 105 minutes I've ever seen in comedy.I was able to catch one of the black curtain screenings that myspace put on in Anaheim. Some may ask why I was waiting in a line for 3 hours, an the answer I will give you is Jonah Hill. My buddy and I think that he is the funniest thing to ever appear on a screen. I don't want to spoil this movie for anyone, but basically you should go see it. You will laugh, no matter who you are, and it is every actor at his or her finest. If you liked knocked up or 40 year old virgin, you will love this movie. It has the same feel to it, but a totally different premise. Jonah Hill is at his best and so is Rogen. Seriously, just go see it.An instant classic, this is one of the most hilarious comedies ever. Not only is it very entertaining, original and refreshing, but its not slow like Napoleon Dynamite or something like that. Jonah Hill, Cera and Mintz-Plasse have amazing on-screen chemistry while Bill Hader and Seth Rogen are great as the two renegade police officers. Anybody who does not watch Superbad, has been deprived of seeing one of the funniest movies ever. There are plenty of amazing jokes, scenes and scenarios in this movie, and ultimately it never gets old. I am going to buy this movie and watch it every now and then, because its worth it. IMDb Rating: 7.9. MY Rating: 10/10
