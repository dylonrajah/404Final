When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer, I was pretty excited. I wasn't a major Transformers fan, but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However, I hated the re-designed Transformers, thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego's Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor, so I decided to skip this one.However, I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. "The greatest film of all time!" people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren't the robots I grew up with, this was a "new" version, and I'd at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I'd even go see this even though I don't like Michael Bay films.How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and self-indulgent piece of crap. I understand that I'll get rated down for my review, but I'm prepared to accept that. Sadly, my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got, causing me to gush over this film like other people.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another, and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line, but the action was good, showed the consequences of war, and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos, even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you've seen before.Bumblebee sends up an "Autobat Symbol" to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There's a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 (and a few scenes later, uses the exact drumbeat from the "Terminator Theme"). The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and "shaky cam" style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were "Saving Private Ryan" caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene, the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically, that it makes the tragedies found in "Schindler's List" seem modest.The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy, which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble, and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from "Trilogy of Terror". During the final battle, I was having problems telling who was who, and when the robots collided, it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases, ripped straight from a commercial. Then again, there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.The slow set-up to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like "The Hulk". I pay for a movie about transforming robots, that's what I want to see.Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam, a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this "All-Spark" out of the desert and into a heavily-populated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful, sounded like it was written for teenagers, by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn't seem to kill a Decepticon, but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee, but they can't repair Jazz? What was the difference? The government/military/robot/anyone dialogue was totally unrealistic, with officials willing to "bet their ridiculously high government paychecks" on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns, clich√©s, or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn't touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry, where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and fun-loving with a sense of style, while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity, and I felt insulted. Not because of the language, but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren't much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously, Bay's madness knew better than to totally ruin this character, as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene, where Prime's personality suddenly shifts, breaks character, and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene, he shifts back into a "leader" personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), who brought a credible "gee whiz" performance to the film, and yet I felt sorry for him using such ham-fisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for "blockbuster" films, as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards, "sit back, not think and enjoy" with these types of films, but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart, personality or no focus on the main characters? As a stand-alone film, this is a really bad movie. As a Transformers-licensed film, it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to high-school level online fanfic. This deafeningly loud, obnoxious, usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the all-time greatest summer flicks ever. However, despite the advancements in today's special effects, it being inspired from the highly popular 1980's Hasbro toys and cartoon, with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer, Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a "steaming pile." I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn't work for me.The story was about a teenager name Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who purchases a car that happens to be a robot in disguise from another world. Sam is then caught in the middle of an ancient battle between two groups of these alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Both are seeking a mysterious cube known as the "Allspark" that contains their "life source." This central plot intertwines with the story of a special ops team being attacked by one of the Decepticons in the beginning, the pentagon enlisting teams of computer hackers to decode a signal they detected that ultimately came from the Decepticons and a hokey love story between Sam and Mikaela, the gorgeous bombshell in his class.As intriguing as all of this may sound, besides the many battle scenes, car chases, attempts on Sam's life and Decepticon attacks, nothing happens to move the story along. Whatever layers of stories that were suppose to be happening beneath the unimpressive action sequences were uneventful and slow. So, all you're left with is the action, which by the end was boring and tedious to watch.The characters were flat and moronic. The humans were one-note, soulless caricatures. They were also more than capable of damaging the robots, which took away from the extraordinary antagonism the original cartoon presented for our human heroes. The humans were helpless against the Decepticons and this made the Autobots necessary. In this absurd film, the humans didn't really need the Autobots to take out the Decepticons.And whatever happened to characters like Jorge "Fig" Figueroa and Maggie? They sort or left this film halfway to the end to join the film playing in the theater next door.Also, part of the cartoon's success was the personalities of the Transformers. They were emotional beings that were capable of treacherous, loyal, courageous, cowardice, morose and optimistic behavior. They weren't just giant piles of junk destroying an American metropolis. Whatever happened to the ongoing struggle for power over the Decepticons between Starscream and Megatron? This would've added some real complexity to this paper-thin story. Instead, Bay and the writers settled for hinting at it with a laughable one-liner from Megatron that rang falser than the action. Wasn't Bumblebee the kindest, frailest of them all? He was essential for his undying compassion for the humans in the cartoons. Not in this film, where he obviously fought in many battles and, when annoyed, can urinate on a human being at any given time. Now going from the true character to the characterizations of the robots, the looks of the original were more engaging and attractive to the eye. In this film, they looked like metal scraps of junk.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the Black-American soul, screaming, "What up, b****es?" Ironically, he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now, a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy, unimaginative, sloppy, hack writing and directing. In the end, I couldn't care less about any of the characters, human or Transformer.The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However, when the characters weren't trying to be funny in this film, the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous, with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in, like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons (John Turturro) was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV, revealing Mikaelas' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point, I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides, the whole introducing-yourself-thing from the Transformers, especially the Decepticons, was extra cheddar cheesy to me: "I am Megatron!" Yeah, and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could've gotten the collective "heave-hove" from this film as well.The special effects were cool but could've been better. Most of the time, the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing, unorthodox way they transformed, not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal, revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director, I wouldn't be satisfied with the end result.The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a U-Turn, these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay, maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.In my opinion, Bay, Spielberg and the writers massacred what could've been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst, overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood. (This comment was deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report filed by another user, so I'm guessing it was pretty abusive; maybe it spoiled some aspect of "the plot," if you can call it that, for some poor soul)I think it was about four or five words into the opening narration when we burst into laughter. "Before time began..." Ouch. When a film can't go 5 seconds without a clich√©, it doesn't deserve to be watched, at least not with a straight face.Michael Bay's Transformers is hilariously awful, a sub-Ed Wood affair all the way through, a camp classic in the making. If Bay is the new Edward D. Wood, Jr. then Transformers may be the new Plan 9 from Outer Space. Let me count the ways: 1. Incoherent narration/ incoherent plot? Check.2. Laughably bad dialogue? Check.3. Pompous aliens with inexplicable plan to conquer Earth? Check.4. Day turns to night in an instant? Check.5. Copious use of military stock footage? Check.6. Epic numbers of continuity errors? Check.7. Dramatic confrontations solved via fistfights? Check.8. Dramatic scenes that fly straight out of left field? Check. ("I'm so glad I got in the car with you.") 9. Formerly respectable older star sinks to a new low? Check. (Poor, poor Jon Voight) 10. Incredible overacting that is obviously encouraged by the director? Check.11.Character who cannot speak for no apparent reason? Check.12. Rampant stereotyping (not just the racial ones but stuff like cops acting dumb, doing a lot of shouting, and eating doughnuts, and military officials being all secretive one minute and spilling said secrets the next)? Check.13. Characters with a lot of face time who end up playing no important role in the "story?" Check. (What useful purpose did Duhamel and the troops in Qatar serve after the first ten minutes?) 14. Heavy handed social/political commentary/references? Check. (eBay, eBay, eBay;imagine how much trouble could have been avoided if they'd just BOUGHT THE DAMN GLASSES OFF OF EBAY!) 15. A flying saucer catches on fire then crashes? Check.16. Sudden flashes of light appear from nowhere and knock characters over? Check.17. The action in some shots is hopelessly muddled? Check.18. A character's hilarious death scene is matched only by his hilarious eulogy? Check.19. The action halts suddenly so that someone can explain the back-story? Check.20. Random bursts of laughter fill theater during screening? Check.21. Gaps in dialogue perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque commentary? Check.22. Inevitable cult following? Check.Only these three things are missing, keeping it from true Ed Wood greatness: 1. No giant octopus. (Though Scorponok comes pretty close.)2. No transvestites. (It has the prefix "trans-" in the title, though.)3. No ludicrously campy speech made by the main villain. (Just " I AM MEGATRON!!!", which is plenty campy but not much of a speech.) Maybe these'll be in the director's cut.Except, of course, Ed Wood's movies had heart; even at their worst they feel like more than exercises in feature-length product placement. Bay doesn't have anything even remotely resembling a heart in his chest - that's why he's not even in Wood's league as a bad director, no matter how many laughs his terrible films get. And at least Wood's films didn't cost $150 million to make.I'm a Transformers fan from way back. I've got an Optimus Prime and a Megatron atop one of my bookshelves. I have ancient videotapes of the fondly remembered cartoon series and a copy of the 20th anniversary movie DVD. I had worried that this film would damage my childhood memories beyond repair, like Star Wars Episode I did. But the film is just TOO bad and TOO stupid to have any real effect on me. The old animated movie, bad as it is, mops the floor with this one. If anything, it is a more mature(!) and entertaining work. The music in the old movie is terrible, but it fits. The music here is just terrible.There are good points, but none anywhere near enough. John Turturro is the only actor who escapes this mess unscathed - his great over-the-top performance suggests that he actually understands how Z-grade the script he was given was. He's a lot of fun to watch, even as he's quickly reduced to a non-entity by the plot mechanics. Turturro is a great actor and this part only serves to elevate his status in my eyes. I hope he got a serious paycheck.I can't stand CGI as a rule, but the special effects here are moderately convincing, at least in those rare moments when the camera isn't performing idiotic cartwheels to obscure them. I honestly like the models for the new TFs (the Autobots, anyway - I can barely tell the Decepticons apart), but the fact that they have little personality isn't so endearing.Maybe the sequel will be up to the lofty standards of Ed Wood's Night of the Ghouls. But I doubt it. I honestly don't know where to start with this movie. I will say however, that - like many other people - this is the film I've been waiting 20 years to see.I suppose it's sensible to start with what should be the foundation stone of any cinematic experience - the script. It's cheesy, clich√©-ridden, and poorly-structured. Characterisation (especially of the Autobots/Decepticons) is non-existent. Optimus Prime uttering the words "My bad" must go down in history as one of the worst moments in movie history. Actually scratch that - the "lubricating" scene is definitely worse. The writing of human characters is lazy at best, sticking with stereotypes such as the beautiful code-breaker, fat computer whizz, bumbling government agent etc etc. The performances (Shia aside) are instantly forgettable, but a great deal of that comes down to the script and direction. Megan Fox may be a great actress for all I know, but she may as well be a stripper for the purposes of this movie.The effects are incredible (although not helped by Bay's erratic editing style), but when you've no reason to care about them it results in an empty experience. Effects DON'T MAKE A MOVIE.With Spielberg as part of this project I allowed myself a little optimism, but it's patently clear that Bay and Co. had no understanding or respect for the Transformers franchise. GIANT "FLIPPING" ROBOTS BLOWING "STUFF" UP this may be, but it is most certainly not Transformers. This was one crappy movie and a pain to watch. Just hearing Optimus Prime utter "Oops my bad", made me want to bolt for the door. Anyway, here is just a brief summary of all the good and bad this movie has to offer.The Good:The transformations- I'm surprised at how well they made the transformations work. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron don't look half as bad as I thought they would. It's nice to see the parts warp and change instead of watching these big blocky characters that were in the cartoon.The Bad:On my, where do I start...The jokes were awful. For some reason they decided to make this movie as a crossover between American Pie and Transformers. Bumblee "lubricating" the man and Sam masturbating, just wasn't funny. The only people who were laughing in the audience were little kids.The humans stole the show. I thought Transformers was supposed to be about the Transformers themselves, who each had unique personalities with a little human action thrown in the background. Instead the tables are reversed, where we are FORCED to spend lengthy amounts of time with characters the audience truly doesn't give a rat's ass about. Who cares about Sam Whitwickey? Or that smart programming chick? Or that fat donut eater? Who honestly gives? This is a Transformers movie folks, not a love story with some dumb robots thrown in for kicks. Oh and Sam himself, was super, duper irritating and annoying.The choreography was terrible. Some fight scenes were cool enough but the shaky camera movements and extreme closeups made it difficult to tell what was going on. The fight between Megatron and Optimus proved to be extremely disappointing, as we are only given a few shots of Optimus punching and tripping Megatron, while the army tries to destroy Blackout. -They completely destroyed the Transformers back story. Those even remotely interested in the Transformers will know that they came from Cybertron and that their ship crashed on Earth only to be revived centuries later. But here Cybertron is destroyed to pieces with no chance of it ever being revived. Well, I guess the Transformers are screwed folks ... but they already were when Michael Bay decided to direct.In short, if you were expecting to see a movie about the Transformers, you were sadly mistaken. Be prepared to spend hours focusing on Sam and his loser girlfriend instead. Also, why the hell did it take an hour and a half for Optimus Prime to show up in the first place- that to me, is a disgrace. Tripe. Filth. Mud. Worthless. Blunt. Stupid. These are six words that aptly describe the idea behind Michael Bay's latest smash-fest "TRANSFORMERS." As one of those "poor saps" (as I was called while waiting in the theater) who had never seen the TV show as a child, I went into the movie expecting nothing, especially considering that Michael Bay is one of the least artistic, most pandering directors of the present. But once the movie started, it was all right. Shia LeBeouf was charming, as was the quirky teen-humor that pervaded the first 45 minutes. In fact, the Transformers were pretty bad-ass....Until minute 46, when they began to talk. Not only was their behavior evocative of stoners and idiots, they lumbered around his backyard, and, later in the movie, peed on a federal agent. There was even one transformer (I forget the name, and I am all the better for it) that talked like he was from the "projects." The plotting was puerile and idiotic. There was even a subplot where Shia LeBeouf's love interest was discovered to have a criminal record, but that subplot was handily absolved five minutes later when Shia LeBeouf cuts a deal with the government. SO STUPID AND POINTLESS! Not to mention, the movie abounded with Michael Bay's never-ending car chases and slow-motion hoohah. Very very bad scripting like "I'm not leaving without Bumblebee!" and the leader of the good Transformers saying "Oops, my bad" made for a horrible experience.The bulk of the movie was terrible. The acting, aside from noticeably realistic screams from Shia and others, was stilted and just perfect for the sort of film that doesn't even hide that it relies wholly on special-effects and the toy franchise itself, the kind of things that Michael Bay loves to beat over movie-goers' heads like a blunt object. I saw the advance screening a few days ago and in a nutshell, two whole years of anticipation were stripped away by a flash of severe disappointment within the first 45 mins of this film. I'm a hard-core G1 fan and can't tell you how blasphemous this film is to those of us who who followed the original series from Cybertronian history to character profiles and traits.The script itself is utter garbage and reminiscent of a Disney film with ultra-lame jokes and childish references. The mere reference to teenage masturbation in one scene is just completely uncalled for and unnecessary in this film. Too much focus was placed on the human characters than the Transformers themselves who are the stars of the show. It's sad that the original film in '86 was a lot darker than this slop that Dreamworks has tastelessly thrown together and expected us to swallow. There's absolutely no character development regarding either clan of robots. The only thing keeping my attention was Peter Cullen's voice as 'Prime...that's the ONLY justice Dreamworks has afforded this film. I understand they needed new body styles to fit today's society...not a problem...but they should still have the same basic look in robot mode and the same voices!! Starscream was everyone's favourite Decepticon...he looked awesome and his trademark voice made the character. He's now absolutely hideous, completely beyond recognition and his voice is just as low and bland as the rest of the characters.Way too much comedy in this film...Transformers don't tip-toe around people's front lawns in the middle of the night trying not to be seen by human parents...that's lame. Transformers is an epic, intergalactic war over ENERGON, not this "allspark" that Dreamworks fabricated. It's a dark battle, like Lord of the Rings but with Cybertronians! My last argument has to be the score/soundtrack. Talk about minimalist...Steve Jablonsky did NOTHING for this film. Was Danny Elfman not available?! All my fellow fans out there need to know that the Transformers theme song does NOT even appear in the film, ANYWHERE by ANY means. Not even a melodic reference to it in the orchestral score which I find completely absurd. The band Mute Math did the theme for the soundtrack allegedly though it never actually plays in the film, not even over the end credits!! From start to finish this was absolute mockery of all traits that made the original series and film so great...it's nothing now. I'm forced to pretend this new film doesn't even exist because it's defiled the Transformer name so bad...a complete injustice to my expectations as a true fan. If they have the nerve to make sequels to this slop I refuse to watch. What a huge let down! I'm a transformer fan that was hoping to see a cool SCI-FI about the Transformers, but instead I got a dumb slap stick comedy that makes fun of them. This movie has a randomly generated plot that only matches the worst type of teen comedy. I can't even say it was better then Epic Movie. There was even an American Pie rip off moment where the main human characters parents think he locked the door to masturbate. They even go to the levels as to have a transformer pee on someone. Thinking about this movie gives me a headache and based on the ratings and reviews so far I am extremely concerned about where society is going as whole. You will only like this movie if you are a young teen that does not know any better or you are a babbling(typically obnoxious in theaters)idiot. The only positive thing I can say is that the transformers where done in very good detail, which seems to only make me starve for the movie I had hoped to see.Very very very very sad. Seriously, why do we still see Michael Bay movies? We, as a people, need to unite against him. And how in God's name is this movie in the top 250 right now? This movie is lucky that I just saw Spiderman 3, otherwise this would be the worst movie of all time. Michael Bay just does the same thing in every movie: way too many helicopters, pilots running to their planes, and the flare overhead to alert the planes (why didn't he just use stock footage of Nicholas Cage from The Rock?)And John Turturro, why? You are a great actor, why reduce yourself to this trash? Please tell me you got paid over 10 million for this. Words cannot describe how bad the script of this movie is. I was dying laughing at Optimus Prime's emotional "Were we so different" speech. And the scene at Sam's house that goes on for about 16 hours with the American Pie rip-off? The Transformers are treated like little kids in that scene who say things like "My bad" and "Oops". Are you kidding me? These are The Transformers, not the Ninja Turtles. The thing I don't get is how people liked this movie. Shia wasn't bad and the girl was hot (while doing her best Jennifer Connelly in Blood Diamond impression), but the rest of the characters were miserable. Am I the only one who thinks that Anthony Anderson's line in Entourage ("You need any color in that movie?") is really the only way he gets any acting jobs? Needless to say, I hated this movie and simply laughed at it with my friends the whole time. But I contributed to Michael Bay making more movies, and for that I am sorry It worries me that anyone could actually fall for **** like this in this day and age...Michael Bay's latest crime against the cinema is by far his most by-the-numbers venture yet with so little creativity that it should be considered punishable. Big explosions, high-priced special effects meant to dazzle, generic comedy, and female cast members meant to dazzle are just about all this movie has to offer, and it all culminates in a big battle in downtown Los Angeles that by nature and set-up is almost as implausible as even the inclination that a guy with Shia LeBouf's face could score a pity date with a girl that looks like Megan Fox without fame or fortune to help. Yet as a summer movie the audience is not simply sold this idea but expected to accept it in a "neat" marketable package complete with overwhelming amounts of product placement. As a result a vicious cycle is born. Visuals reign over every aspect of this film as it does in many of its kind which leaves little room for anything else that is supposed to make up a movie, and too often the story is the first victim and audiences buy into it like a toddler distracted by a shiny set of keys. The robot effects are nothing short of impressive, but with the price tag on this production they should be at the least. However movies are not simply pretty moving pictures. The story does matter, and that is why blockbusters are considered by many to be a joke.Transformers is really no different from the blockbusters that have become easy cannon fodder either. Plot-holes and inconsistencies are usually considered a hindrance, but in a movie like Transformers the audience is supposed to accept the idea that taking the catalyst for the movie's battles into town to in affect endanger countless lives is a good plan. Not only that, but taking it by helicopter is safe or sensible when two of the most violent pursuers can easily fly faster and would be willing to shoot the helicopter down. All of the characters are shallow and sometimes superfluous. Look no further than Anthony Anderson's character for an example of a role that takes up time unnecessarily and is ultimately meaningless. In this case even a lead character in Optimus Prime is not fully developed. Much of what we know about him depends solely on preexisting knowledge of the franchise. For anyone else his nobility is simply to be taken at face value without much of a basis. When you see him bypass a crashing helicopter for the "allspark" (*cough*MacGuffin*cough*) it really makes all of the talk about protecting humans feel a little pretentious. Then again the very design of the robots in this movie are contradictory.If the Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be alien robots, their designs don't reflect that at all. The fact that Bumblebee has an engine is really absurd. He's not a car, he just needs to look like one to an outsider. Optimus Prime's face looks like it's constructed of truck parts when if he is meant to be a robot first and truck second he should just have a face...period. The same can be said for all of the robots (look at Blackout's hand in the close-up for example). Too much of their look is steeped in the technology of Earth when that really doesn't make any sense considering their origins. But that's only a part of the problem here. The real problem lies in the shitty cinematography and even lousier action. Fights in this movie look like scrap-metal tumbleweeds. A lot of what goes on is indecipherable nonsense that lasts all of seconds on-screen WHEN it actually is on-screen. Even the climatic final battle is rather anti-climatic.In the end what you're left with is a ****-stain of formula right down to the awful Goo-Goo Dolls song that accompanies the ultra-implausible half-ass teen romantic-"comedy" that most of this movie centers around augmented by pro-militarism in the most idiotic and insipid way. Plenty of detail went into the SFX of the movie, but even that was misdirected. The story didn't receive half as much attention, and it wouldn't have taken 1/8 of the work and that is one of the key flaws. If effects were all that mattered then there really would be no such thing as a good or bad movie (and that goes double for the BS inclination toward "judging a movie for what it is"). Narrative is more important than the "whizz-bang" and "aint-that-cool" of special effects. One need look no further than a lower-tech classic of the genre like Aliens, or Terminator 2 to see my point. Comedy also shouldn't be so painfully transparent as that defeats the purpose of the joke. If you don't see that you probably like this movie. If that's the case then you should know that you're ****ing up the genre for the rest of us... I loved the cartoon series as a kid and, after seeing the commercials, thought it would be freaking awesome. Instead, I wound up stuck in a movie with a ridiculous plot, too many irrelevant characters, and too much sex humor for a movie that is supposed to be about giant robots wailing on each other (I am in my twenties and male, so I can hardly be considered a prude. The fact that even I cringed at the mother making masturbation jokes means that there is such a thing as a limit for that sort of humor). Most of the Transformers do not even show up until the movie is halfway over. The subplot of the signal detection team (who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the network-a no-brainer) could be cut without losing anything of note (except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's on-screen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool). And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent, and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar, but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie. If you copy and pasted scenes from Independence Day, Matrix Revolutions, a bunch of US air force commercials and Bad Santa all together on your computer, you would wind up with basically the same mess. 10 reasons but I could write 1001:1-) Optimus Prime, Megatron (what was with that voice?), Soundwave, Starscream, were they supposed to be the ones wee saw in the cartoons? 2-) Where was UltraMagnus, HotRod and others...? 3-)Humans are suppose to be helpless against Decepticons and Autobots!!! 4-) Transformers are supposed to be about transformers! 5-) Confusing action scenes! Who's shooting who? 6-) High school students are the best sound analyst the US government is capable to get! hahaha! ;) 7-) A hand full of hole plots! 8-) Final battle is planned to be taking in the city by US military forces! OK! That's credible ;) 9-) Megatron killed by Sam! What the f*** 10-) I took my girlfriend to see this movie, big mistake! ;) I always liked Transformers, and this movie was one of my must-see-this-year, I really wanted to see this one so, but now Im now I just want to forget it.The movie is full of incomplete scenes and things that don't have anything to do with the rest of the movie at all. And all the obvious product placement scenes made it look like long commercial some times.The camera angel was just awful and painful to see, unnecessary zooms and when somebody is running it shakes like a earthquake and you can't see the person is running in a forest or a city.The animation scenes was quite okay, but when people was running throughout the Transformers, I became frustrated, but when they ran throughout the broken lamp post I almost ran out.I had hoped for a more serious movie but, when I laugh it wasn't for the jokes but for how bad the movie was.So to end this, I think you should watch the previews and trailers instead they were much better and cheaper. Enjoy! I went into this movie expecting mindless action and cool looking robots, and was very disappointed. Forget that it had almost no story, and the story it did have was lame. Forget that it was basically a two-hour commercial for the army. The bottom line is that this was the worst looking 150 million dollar movie I have ever seen. It looked like a bunch of actors in front of a blue screen pretending to interact with extremely cartoonish-looking robots.And what was that garbage about how most of the transformers almost never spoke? It was like they couldn't be bothered to write dialogue, so they made the robots mostly mute, and tried to fill time with lame sub-plots like the army guy trying to get home to see his daughter. Seriously, any jerk can try to pull you in with cheap sentimentality, but it is pretty obvious that Michael Bay couldn't make a movie with anything resembling real emotion or dialogue if his life depended on it. With this movie, Bay has solidified his position as the worst director of our generation. I would rather watch two hours of security camera footage of a garbage dump that watch this movie again. This movie really makes you wonder about lots of things:1. Does it have a screenplay or is the plot made up along the way? (Like the last seasons of X-Files :) ) 2. If it does have a screenplay why was it written the way it was? A. The screenplay writers where stupid. B. The public that the screenplay was intended for is stupid. C. The screenplay was made to make the public stupid (which goes under government conspiracy theories :) ). 3. Do movie directors have sex in periods between two films? 4. Are some of the IMDb comments written by the movie promoters? 5. What is colder outer space or North Pole? (check the Wikipedia for that one :))And some trivial questions like:6. Why do small robots act like gremlins? (from the movie gremlins that is) 7. How can a robot from another planet know when you plan to buy a used car? 8. Do used cars come with some kind of papers (previous owners, registration plates, etc)? 9. What can a robot gain by hooking up two teenagers? 10. Can a teenager out run a robot that can change himself into a car? 11. Can a teenager defeat a robot in hand to hand combat if the robot previously killed loads of air force 1 security team members? 12. If you where frozen on North Pole years before 1897 (there was no radio or TV stations back then and certainly there was no Internet) how is it possible that you can speak fluent English upon your unfreezing? 13. After being frozen for decades would your first word be: "I am Megatron."? 14. Would you arrange a massive fight in an overpopulated area or in a desert? 15. How is it that an entire army base is destroyed by just one robot but the same robot is killed by one man?There are loads of questions more but my mind is too buffled by the recent movie experience. But the biggest question is:16. How many times is the computer animation budget larger than the screenplay budget?A. 2 times? B. 100 times? C. 1.000.000 times? D. 0 times (cos you can't divide a number by 0)? Ah, so clever they are at throwing all the best bits of the film into one trailer.I was close to giving it a 2 . .but no, I'm sorry, they really don't deserve it :) For the first ten to twenty minutes of this film I had relatively good vibes. But then something happened, and quite rightly as another user has stated, it starts a down hill spiral.It's quite obvious why this one was released for independence day. It has all the elements. .ludicrous plot, abominable script, lots of things blowing up with sparks and fireworks. Those, and the usual actors thrown in to do nothing more than show a comedic face while performing some antic in the film purely to raise the laughter bar.I know that this was an adaptation, I know that it was not meant to be taken seriously; unfortunately the film makers are asking me to deal with two different kinds of movie here. The first, a semi serious military campaign going badly wrong with Robot invasion. The second, little Johnny and potential love interest counterpart have to save the world from evil robot dominance; they do this after the robots suss out who they are courtesy of ebay and with a succession of ridiculous and badly staged situational hazards.I'm sorry, but no amount of special effects or large robots rolling around in the air and into each other can save something that was conceived on Stifflers homework paper.I lost respect for this film the moment it turned into something that pubescent teens would find wildly entertaining."Bros not Ho's man!" Titters the youth three rows down the isle in the auditorium.The product placement was ingenious I have to say, the pepto(a)bysmol on the table after the black guy has finished his plate of ten to fifteen donuts, I'm so glad they don't stereo type.I didn't intend to rip this film apart for all it's cute moments of Robotic wisdom, but well, I guess like Modern day Hollywood, I just got carried away. A scurvy turkey, with exhausting visuals, poor characterization (no need to ask why Megan Fox was cast for this movie; J. Voight et J Turturro, almost not recognizable, leave no imprint on this film, obviously came to collect, nothing more)... As usual with Michael Bay : heat, big machines (copters or planes, depending on film period), guns, brainless teenagers, big cars, dazzling visuals: summer blockbuster all right....but hey, what did I expect? This is a Michael Bay movie. This sums it up. No need to have a script (map engraved on glasses, uh?) when the point is to relaunch a toy line, make some product placement and re-use an existing idea (bad vs evil... black vs white... which means here : Autobots vs Decepticons) "The Worst Film Ever Made" was a previous title I held for another Michael Bay film Armageddon. I'm not a fan of his movies but I was however willing to give this movie a chance as it looked like fun. I was never a fan of the original cartoon as I was too old at the time but I did see and enjoy the carton Movie in 1996. I'm aware that Transformers is a summer blockbuster and is supposed to be lighthearted fun so I can forgive it the terrible and clich√©d romance between the beauty and the geek and the many corny lines but it kept throwing so many curve balls my way I couldn't ignore the many flaws and eventually I switched off the DVD. I neither know, nor care, how it ended. Why do I think it was so bad? There is the complete absence of a story. Robots come to earth and fight, the end. The acting went from mediocre to bad. When the robots are finally introduced the movie changes tone from semi serious mood to wise cracking silly antics ¬ñ jarringly. The various Transformers are introduced in a sloppy, and anything but memorable manner, which shows what a clumsy director Michael Bay is. The robots themselves are badly designed and 'transform' in an abstract blur of fancy CGI only to distract that there is no cohesive design ¬ñ there is a truck, spinning CGI, then there is a robot, they do not actually transform at all. The cheap plastic toys you could get in the 80s were more impressively designed. The flashy but inadequate robot design meant the fight sequences were an unchoreographed mess that completely lacked tension. On top of that there is a shocking approach to casual violence which is surprising considering Steven Spielberg's recent outburst against violence on TV. A man is flicked aside against a car which would obviously kill him for a throw away gag. A building is ripped through by two fighting robots as you see people running around on the various floors before they die. I'm guessing Bay thought it would be clever to see such detail but I felt it was gratuitous and sickening. Other utterly ridiculous ideas are weak but when the giant pyramid of Giza size cube folds itself up into a Rubix cube size key ornament my common sense just wanted to bail out of the movie altogether. I know it's only a movie and I shouldn't even be thinking about physics, I know the average age watching the movie wouldn't be bothered, and I'm no science geek but it is just so impossible for that much mass to disappear and I just had to laugh at the concept. The robots have such little 'humanity' in their personalities that during the 'death sequence' I really couldn't have cared less. At the final fight sequence I was so bored, as I said earlier, I just switched off the DVD and went to bed. The Worst FIlm Ever Made isn't hyperbole, Michael Bay worked hard to earn that credit. Because for some reason I felt as if I were watching a deranged 144 minute "Victoria's Secret models meets Chevy Car Company Robots" commercial. I knew the movie would be bad, I just never thought that it would be THAT bad. I'm a pretty open minded person, I can live with a few plot holes in the story, even some cheesy lines thrown here and there, (I watched ID4 for God's sake). This movie just defies all of that ... I have never wanted to leave the theater as much as I did that night.I can't explain it ... I am upset about sitting there for over two hours and watching this travesty. I am upset about contributing to the gross for opening weekend. I am upset about watching a Michael Bay film. But overall, I think that I am just upset that this movie just really, really sucked. The special effects were good but even they couldn't save the movie. They couldn't save the horrible acting, they couldn't save the lack of story ... everything is one dimensional and I just didn't care about anything or anybody. The ending battle dragged, there was no suspense, there was no emotion ... truly a waste of time. This new transformers movie may possibly be the worst movie i've ever seen. I went into this movie expecting to see a good action movie with a pretty bad plot. Boy was I disappointed. The over top humor that is wedged into the movie at every possible second coupled with the incredibly annoying and uninteresting back story of our "heros" makes it impossible for the actual Transformers, which did look really cool, to pull this movie out of the garbage. The Transormers themselves looked great and when they actually fought each other, between peeing on people and making ridiculous jokes, it was fun. But those few minutes of enjoyment can't save the movie.I'm 32 and I've loved transformers most of my life. I was really hoping that this movie would do them justice, but it doesn't. The movie is impossible to take seriously on any level. Largely because of the "Jar Jar Binks" transformer that is running around through out the entire movie and the other endless "comedic" moments. I hope you, reader, enjoy the movie more than I did. When watching the movie ask yourself one question. Why would they relocate the climatic battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons from the safety of an isolated desert to a large city filled with innocent lives. It doesn't make sense. This movie is very BAD, but I bet you're gonna watch it anyways This has to be the most disappointing movie I've watched this year. What a let down! It's probably up there with great franchise flops like Dungeon & Dragons (which was really really bad) and Terminator 3 which was nowhere close to the very much dated T1 & T2.Sure, I understand this Transformers is a Michael Bay Transformers (made 2007 and not 1980s) it shd be different .yes yes but almost everything lacked character!I guess what I wanna say is a good movie is timeless. It tells a good story and leaves deep impression in the audience. 50 years from now, you may tell people about an excellent movie you've watched in 2007, but it's probably NOT Transformers.If you are a 5-year old kid, you may like the movie. If you are an adult with no great expectations, you may find it visually entertaining. If you are a Transformers fan I suggest not watching it cos it may spoil your day, as it did with mine. But you probably are gonna watch it anyways as I did cos it's TRANSFORMERS tsk tsk ‚òπ Im sorry, i no ill get slated to hell for this but every single person who gave this film anything more than a 5 out of 10 is clearly delusional and need serious mental help immediately for the sake of the planet and the universe at large! I don't dislike that many films I'm usually quite easy to please but this film was easily one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to sit through! It started out so well ¬ñ that initial sequence in the army base was amazing and I was captivated ¬ñ i expected so much after that and then it just died ¬ñ much like I wished I would so i would have to see or hear any more of it! This film was exceptional for being one of the few that actually didn't work on any level at all! The plot was paper thin at best and I'm sorry but the largest part of the film was nothing more than filler! SECTOR 7!!!!!! OMG Christ on a bike what was that about!!! Seriously!!! It was the most ridiculous piece of anti American diatribe that I have ever seen and the thin veil of anti American feeling that surrounded these idiotic characters was nothing less than disgusting! Are we really meant to believe that the highest level of American security is entrusted to someone that would make a t-shirt like that for themselves ¬ñ seriously ¬ñ what was realistic about that or funny for that matter! People who thought that was funny are very easily amused! Then there was the notable lack of a President! Again, are we actually supposed to believe that during a time of extreme crisis that the President wouldn't be at the helm taking control? Again the anti American/anti Bush feeling in this film was well over the score and completely unnecessary in this film! If you want to take a shot at Bush do what Moore does and do it upfront and in person and don't ruin perfectly good films for it! Then there's Megatron! How, pray tell, did the generally primitive people of the world manage to transport this huge lumbering behemoth from deep below the arctic ice to somewhere in America (Hoover Dam wasn't built until the 1930s) given how large and heavy he would be ¬ñ and how did they keep him frozen during this time without the obvious aid of cryogenics. It may be a small gripe but its part of the huge number of inconsistencies that exist in this film! The scene outside Sam's house is painful ¬ñ giant robots playing hide and go seek ¬ñ I actually thought I smelled the BS during that scene ¬ñ not only was it excruciatingly painful but it was far too long! This could have been such an amazing film and MICHAEL BAY destroyed it ¬ñ not only that he destroyed the film, raped its mother, pi*sed all over its dad and systematically mutilated all of its siblings! And, it should not be forgotten that Spielberg was involved in this ¬ñ I can only think he was asleep the whole time! I can only hope that they bring in Bryan Singer or someone who actually knows what they're doing with this kind of film and chain Bay to the underside of a boat and leave him there to rot and not ruin any more potentially fantastic films! PS wow that was scathing wasn't it ¬ñ honestly I hated the film but I've read too many high and mighty comments from people who said they loved it and slated those that hated it! If there are police officers reading this I promise I have no intention of chaining Michael Bay to the underside of a boat please don't arrest me LOL! Yes, I loved Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but Steven Spielberg is the executive producers of garbage flicks like War of the Worlds and AI, both testimonials to lavish over-budgeting and plot less rambling in scriptwriting. Well, I guess he put Michael Bay in front of this over-bloated silly mess, Transformers, so that he could be the crap shield.This movie is the war sequence we wanted but were denied in War of the Worlds, played in over-sized, out-of-focus for the most part, and boringly-repeated fashion, between the "good" Autobots and the "evil" Decepticons who are after a source of unlimited power that landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and discovered by the grandfather of soon- to-be-metro-sexual-wimp Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf. Apparently the map of the location of this "Allspark" is etched on his grandfather's glasses, which he possesses.At any rate, through twist of fate, Sam obtains a car, which is an Autobot in disguise, and picks up a jock-chasing chick Mikaela Banes, played by Megan Fox. From that point on, the movie is a mindless array of action sequences as the Decepticons make their way to Earth and attempt to cripple all defense and communications prior to a battle with the Autobots.My main problem with this film is that it spends virtually all its time in overblown (and out of screen scope) CGI action sequences that are either too close up to fully comprehend or almost too fast to make any sense of. John Voight is wasted in the role of the Secretary of Defense, choosing to take the paycheck and act like a slightly-intellectual hard-headed redneck bureaucrat instead of playing an interesting character.The rest of the performances by cast are really unmemorable, and the action sequences are just a jumbled mess. The other annoying aspect of this film is that it is a virtual commercial for Chevrolet, Taco Bell, and every other kind of franchise item (candy, tools, and cars), and the actors use their names with great repetition. I have to assume that the executive producer of this film (no stranger of clich√© ad usage, remember Reese's Pieces in E.T.?) was banking on merchandising revenues if the film failed at the box office.In the end, it is another brainless, mindless thrill ride we expect from Spielberg. Thank God he has Michael Bay to point the finger of blame should this thing fail. This movie has the indelible mark of the ultimate King of Cinema Crap, Steven Spielberg, and has a similar feel of his "epic" action films.I would not even bother renting this one. It really is not worth the viewers time. As nigh unto impossible as it may seem, the master of Second Unit Cinema- none other than Mr. Michael "Oy vey" Bay- has rocketed to the top of the charts with his take on the old TRANSFORMERS toytoons. (I was one of those who watched the original series when it aired because, even though it wasn't- nor isn't, nor ever shall be- food for thought, it beat the daylights- then, as even now, believe it or not- out of the infinitely inferior Americanimation to be found on the tube... or even on the Big Screen, for the most part... again, to this very day.) Even Second Unit Cinemasters like Tim Story (whose FANTASTIC BOREs run a close second and third to TRANSFORMERS) can't begin to come close to what Mr. Bay has wrought. Bay, unlike Story, at least had the good sense to go with a full cgi cast and thereby save himself the embarrassment of working with real, live human beings. (One of the cgi even looks like Angelina Jolie's father. The geniuses who generated these computer images must take a bow- as should their computers, who did most of the work, anyway.) By handing the reins of most of the film over to the techs, Bay frees himself up to do what he does best: direct the second unit. It was nothing less than a stroke of genius. If there's another director more worthy of the title of Master Of Second Unit Cinema than Bay, I've missed him. Pardon me if this review comes out as somewhat unorganized. It's just that all of my thoughts are currently jumbling together because of how bad this movie really is.This is by far the worst movie of the year. It's bad, even for Michael Bay. Whoever said earlier that the action shots were full of too many zooms, kudos to them because they are right on the money. My friend nearly puked a little when they played music from "Kill Bill Vol 1" in it. Another problem I had with it was that it kept changing from day to night at random when it was obviously a continuation of the same scene. John Turturro was highly miscast in the movie, as well as Jon Voit. Please, don't waste your time. It's awful. It makes me ashamed to be an American. "The Triumph of Will" was a Nazi propaganda movie that brainwashed millions of people into believing that the Nazi's were fighting for a just cause; that's still not half as bad as "transformers." I even refuse to capitalize "transformers" because it is so rotten.PS - QUIT RATING THE MOVIE TEN STARS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!!!
