... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.So, let's count off:Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: "Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all."Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed "I feel a little dizzy" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch "I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!" dialog? Check.Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour. i went in expecting a scary monster movie.what i got was 15 minutes of bad TV dialog, and 45 minutes of shaky-cam running through the streets. the acting was OK but the characters were really unpleasant. not only did i not care if they died, by the end of the movie i was rooting for the monster.there were a lot of plot holes and the decisions everyone made were totally unrealistic. it was hard to stay in the movie because of the constant lapses of common sense and logical flaws. those kinds of things really annoy me when they could have been fixed with a line or two of dialog.finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time. What on earth is this movie doing with a 8.1/10 rating?I think I'm being kind with a 3/10. It is just as a big a disaster for me as its trying to portray(but fails completely)Now what puzzles me is why on earth would you go completely calm and focused towards an alien monster trashing the city with bombs being dropped on it? O please..to save a women who should have been dead but miraculously survives. She has a metal rod through her chest (or i think it was, with all that nauseating camera work) and should have died of loose of blood.... Now another thing i don't quite get is the camera...hmmm 10 hours of battery..yea, Captures all the good bits of an exiting adventure,HD quality and doesn't run out of battery or stop working from all the times its dropped and thrown in the movie! God i have to find a place where they sell these!And now onto the acting...acting? Its not hard to scream and look really scared which is all they do..they don't even need to look convincing because half the time the camera is trying to look really really realistic and is filming the ground. Now this guys best friend that is filming...i don't think i have come across a narrator that annoying. What does he do in the movie apart from saying..omg what just happened dude?..what was that?Dude this is scary. I mean what the ****?When he finally dies after miraculously surviving a helicopter crash with his friends i rejoiced! Sorry for not knowing his name but even now i don't even know who's who?Just don't bother with this movie, please I'm glad i only downloaded it first before going out to watch in the cinemas. You'll be wishing the movie to end so you can get on with your life. I will admit, the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean, I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However, it's hard to have this curiosity, no matter how intriguing the monster is, when the script is so tired its in a coma.Yes, the monster is cool. No, the stupid hand-held camera gimmick didn't bother me. Yes, the special effects are great and at times I did find myself in awe of the spectacle on the screen as it does seem real, but the movie itself is so, so, so dumb. At any moment I felt comfortable to leave to use the restroom as I knew exactly what I was going to miss. The plot was a paint by numbers and I would have loved even a touch of Bob Ross to fill the blanks, but no originality whatsoever.First they steal the overdone Hollywood bit about love. "Dude, if you love her, tell her." Response: "I can't tell her, unless a mutant alien/ocean creature tries to expunge the city, only then will I try and make my move." Why have this? Why not make the story the monster? Really, who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found, which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.Second, they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. "Let's try night vision on the camera." And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons, ones we can't see coming (which is why I think those monsters were blind). Cloverfield does none of this. It's a, where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie, he's not funny, just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV, but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was "That's terrible" when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by, "That's terrible too" when we see when of its young-lings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie, words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter, "That's terrible cubed" before he was engorged upon. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Fourth, we have the killer/villain/monster has one last leap. Yes, we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. "We killed him" Hud proclaims, just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary, why? Oh, it's not scary, and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. Fifth, they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever, because King should always have chapters taken out, and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise, they may actually need to give the characters some arc, have some purposeful shots of the monster, maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and, uh-oh, give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did, I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it, as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing, but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good, but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful, but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T-2, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant film-making. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there, I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over, I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny, which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook, trite, clichéd, not smart, overdone, not scary, bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2, but pretty darn close. I have to hand it to JJ Abrams....we fell for this flick hook line and sinker.The only downside is it COMPLETELY lacked substance. There was NO story. We went to see a monster movie only to find out NOTHING...I mean NOTHING about it. It was about stupid people who were unwilling to leave the city...and then were killed. Big deal.In the end you didn't know how the monster got there, if they actually killed it, what it's powers were, what the little monsters were, where it came from, what it wanted....you never even got to see the entire shape of it or the use of all it's body parts.It is the only movie I have ever wanted to walk out of. I just kept waiting for it to get better.If Abrams ends Lost this way the world is going to come unglued!!!!! Well, I clicked spoiler, but the spoiler is that there are no spoilers. Nothing to the movie.About 75% of the audience hung around through the end credits, and let me tell you, that was universally the most negative reaction I have ever seen to any movie in a theater.Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe how these people felt (at least according to how they expressed themselves).The movie is, fortunately, short; only 90 mins or so long. 20 mins of that is spent at a party you would leave after 10 minutes if you hadn't paid to get in--a going away party for some loser that looks like a guy from your company's mail room. Apparently this loser has been promoted (improbably) to be a VP for his company in Japan.The party apparently is intended to set up whatever is supposed to pass for the movie's paper thin plot line. All it did for me was condition me to the intentionally awful camera-work. Yeah, I realize it is stylistic and all---but bad camera-work doesn't pass for action. No, running through a crowd jostling a camera around does not translate to movie magic on screen.There will be internet fan boys that will tell you the movie is great, a must see, very intense. Whatever. They are deluding themselves. These people will have spent the last year or more pumping this movie for JJ Abrams and will be unable to admit to themselves or you that it is simply not good. Hey, have ten bucks and two hours of your life to blow? Why not try Cloverfield! If you like motion-sickness inducing, hand-held, close-up, can't-focus-on-anything movies (a.k.a., anything by Michael Bay) then this is a movie for you and your six second attention span! Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there. In the meantime all of the monster crap interrupts a very special episode of Dawson's Creek, you know, the one where Dawson's going to leave for Japan and he finds out at the party that Joey's been sleeping around on him? Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.But hey, on the bright side, everyone died and that made me smile.It's a big-budget C-movie, and while that may sound like something entertaining to fans of shlock films, trust me when I tell you that it's not. Give me Godzilla vs. Mothra any day over this steaming pile. At least those movies have heart. I am more of a "vote and not post" person but I have to at least get the word out that this movie is terrible!! People just need to AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS . . . . not your wallet costs!! 20 minutes of Blair Witch type camera-work for a going-away-party. The rest with unsteady camera shots that totally gave me a migraine headache. Horrible!! Storyline was poor and VERY slow. I kept finding moments to just close my eyes and try to make the agony stop. The ending was one of those where you look at your movie companion(s) and say, "ummm, is that it??? oh wait, there has to be more" and you sit and sit and realize that it's over. My friend and I agree that it is a mix of Blair Witch meets Starship Troopers meets Aliens. What a waste of time and money. This movie would have been good if the camera was put down and a film was made. When the attack began the director should have the camera dropped then pan out and the movie start. Film the characters running and trying to rescue their friend. But, the way the movie was videotaped made the footage jerky and nauseating to watch. The fighting between the army and the "monster" was good, but again left you with too many unanswered questions. Besides, when a rescue helicopter takes off they do not fly parallel to the danger, they would fly away from danger. The ending was empty and left the viewers full of questions. Nothing was ever explained. Just stay at home and watch some home movies taped by your three year old. Might make more sense. I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film, I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.I didn't like this clichéd film. I believe it is a flawed exercise about character perspective and documented realism. However, the special effects were poor but some of them passable; the editing kept an appropriate rhythm; the performances were regular, with the clear exception of T.J. Miller who played the obnoxious camera man, Hud. He did an awful job.My main dislikes with this film were the camera movement and the argument overall.First, the camera moves excessively all time. Even during the party sequence, all the scenes are horribly captured. Hud wasn't running from a monster then, was he? I get the filmmaker's intention, but I felt more nauseated than afraid because they went too far with their movement. The moment I dissociated myself from the movie and started feeling trapped inside a really expensive handy-cam, I knew the original intention had gotten lost. In that respect, the Blair Witch Project (which I also didn't like, but for other reasons) is superior by far. Its technical proposal does help convey a profound emotional impact; whereas Cloverfield's camera trembling doesn't. Consequently, the characters on Cloverfield remain mostly aloof, which really makes some silly elements in the plot to stand out.SPOILERS START NOW: That brings me to my second main dislike: the argument. Were they joking? I don't even mean the monster. It's a monster movie, so I won't even go there. Everyone goes to save Beth, the romantic interest of Rob, who is beyond logical salvation. Sure, Rob's friends try to stop him from going to his certain death, but they all end up joining him anyway (!) Consequently, "Beth" becomes more of a cheap plot device than a character.But I mean Marlena joined them? From what we know of her, she wouldn't. That's character inconsistency right there. So, let's assume she had her psychological reasons to do it. She's after all supposedly human and complex. But throughout her time on the screen nothing happens to shed any light as to why she is with them. So, there's no depth to her. No need for her, expect to save Hud's life once.Also, the love story between Rob and Beth rests so much in what some people say of them and a few lines between the wretched lovers, that it becomes shallow and boring. Sure, some say he's been in love with her forever and they do share a wonderful day at Columbus Circle and Coney Island. Of course, she has got to be the love of his life. I'm not cynical, and I actually enjoy romantic themes, but this was an insult. I mean, the whole story rests so much on this supposed doomed love that it ought to have been better explored. The performances were so flat in this category, that they didn't help either. Again, the love story turned into yet another sort of plot device.When the friends "rescue" Beth from her building, she is severely injured, and yet she can walk and even run. At the end, when they arrive to the evacuation area, despite her bleeding injury, Beth is not the first one to climb into the helicopter. In fact, she has to wait for another helicopter to take her out because the soldiers offer the only seat to Lily, who is physically well. It is ridiculous. Obviously, the real reason the filmmakers did that is so that the lovers, Rob and Beth, could remain together until the end. Have I said plot device before? Cheap and trashy plot device? And there's more, much more rubbish like that throughout the film. SPOILERS HAVE ENDED. Also, the fact that Hud was filming everything -even in the party- almost every private moment, is ludicrous. The filmmaker's choice of the handy-cam as the true narrator is too limited, so he naturally had to use it to an unbelievable degree. The consequence is that the purpose of capturing a sense of realism is defeated, and Cloverfield ends up being an absurdly unrealistic movie in its own monster-destroying-New-York-movie context-.In Cloverfield, the filmmakers ask you to accept too many things just as they tell you they are. However, the movie consistently fails to provide you with valid reasons for doing so. They keep forcing on you a story of the poorest quality. It's almost offensive.Weak screenplays do that. And when they do, one at least expects something in return, whether a feeling or a memorable moment. Something that would justify the torture. Unfortunately, with Cloverfield one ends up empty-handed, jerky camera movements aside.I don't recommend this film at all, especially if you value the use of a tripod or the meaning of storytelling. In any case, if you're going to see it, please don't expect anything great and try not to eat or drink liquids for a couple of hours before and while watching it. In all honesty, it can make you feel physically (as well as mentally) nauseated. This has got to be the worst monster movie I have ever seen! Wait, not worst monster movie, worst MOVIE PERIOD! The whole movie is laughable. I sat there in the theater and wanted to know if and when anything was going to start. First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even starts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party guests and drunken camera wedding style say "hi" to Rob before he goes to Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you that they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip about 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of initial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens that keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses of it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big disappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even remotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body parts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three spots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They are used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting, and it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit longer. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship Troopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they just don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from Japan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the Japanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no Cloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the Godzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez called! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair Witch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home. I was very excited to see this movie when I entered the theater on Wednesday afternoon.I was very impressed with the trailers that were on the screen before the main show;"CLOVERFIELD". But as the movie started I felt I had entered a bad dream, one that I could not wake up from! As I sat there, in the first 10 Mins., my brother-in-law got so sick with all the "camera shake" that he had to leave the theater.The first 20mins. was so boring I almost got up to join him. The plot was so vague that I felt I had walked in in the middle of the movie. Now some people would say; Why did you stay and watch such a bad movie? Well, let me tell you , I am a great lover of movies and consider myself a movie expert,"self proclaimed Of course"and I will almost never walk out,but this movie came very close.The monster had no personality and was boring!And at the end it just stops.YES STOPS! with no explanation of anything...the people...the monster....the city....nothing! You might think,"Great there's going to be a Sequel" I say no way,I hope they make a bundle on this one cause- Fool me once shame on you but fool me twice shame on me and then shoot me in the head to put me out of my misery!Bottom line THIS MOVIE SUCKED! Thank you for reading this hopes this helps. There were two interesting things about seeing this movie, unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie, that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be, raw footage. The acting was lacking at best, the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot, which it *might* have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.But even the worst visual movies can have a deeper meaning, right? So what about this one? There are obvious 9/11 references/similarities, for instance, it was an attack on NYC. The imagery of terrified people running through the streets from the dust clouds of a collapsed building would conjure thoughts of 9/11 in even the most dim witted person. But as much as you pick this one apart there wasn't any purpose beyond using it as an implement to regurgitate fear. No, this movie isn't some sort of pompous social commentary on the American dream/lifestyle/people/whatever. It's actually quite empty as far as metaphor/meaning goes. But honestly, it's not like people would expect that from a monster movie anyway, right? Although it was the connection this movie shared with 9/11 that brings me to my first interesting point. Almost every time a tragedy of this proportion occurs there are countless stories (books, movies or any other medium) that reference it (however vaguely) for decades to come. For example, look at post-Nagasaki/Hiroshima Japan. I'd be curious to see the list of movies that depict the mass destruction of Tokyo via atomic or nuclear bomb. Not to mention the other Japanese movies that center around the general ruining of cities... mostly by a few specific gigantic monsters... which will remain unnamed. The second interesting thing happened to be something which I've never witnessed in a movie theater before. It made it worth paying the ten dollars for a ticket, wasting an hour and half of my life and enduring a headache the camera work gave me. As the ending credits started and the lights slowly came back on the audience unanimously started trash-talking the movie. There was booing from all corners of the theater, someone seated behind me said harshly "this movie sucked!", and the girl who was with him asked him, "what did you drag me to??" Their reactions were fairly amusing, and undoubtedly the best part of the whole movie experience. All in all there were a couple of really cool visuals in the movie... Unfortunately this alone isn't worth the price of the movie, not even the price of the DVD, not even the price of the DVD once it goes into the "shitty $3.99 movie bin" at best buy. Either stay clear of this one or if your curiosity gets the best of you find a pirated version for free.::SPOILER:: Oh, and before I forget. For all the reported "realism" in this movie I'd like someone to explain to me exactly how a plastic video tape survives the tens of millions of degrees caused by the blast of a nuclear bomb......But now I'm just being nit picky. Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs. It appears that the writers had the idea of the Statue of Liberty having its head roll down a street and then struggled like crazy to pad the rest of the movie. Hence it is extremely short and extremely bad.The storyline that drives the characters within spitting distance of the monster at every opportunity is flimsy at best and to be honest, even though it is a movie about a monster terrorising a city it's the small things in it that make it most unbelievable. The fact that the guy talks the military into letting him risk his life (for a girl he slept with once by the way!), the exploding people, the fact that you can abuse a camera so badly and still have it work, the fact that you can buy a phone battery in a shop and not have to charge it before use, the convenient buildings propping each other up allowing for a daring rescue, the immense healing capabilities of the main characters who survive impalement and a crashing helicopter with barely a scratch, carrying the camera incessantly throughout this whole 'terrifying' ordeal, the stare out between monster and camera man at the end. I could go on but its making me feel ill thinking about this movie so much, so soon after seeing it.The fact that you can barely make out what is going on doesn't help either. I think it was meant to add grit and suspense to the film, only giving you fleeting glimpses of the monster, but in the end it just helps to tarnish this train wreck of a movie even further by making sure its a blurred mess.I left the cinema feeling cheated of my money. If it wasn't by J.J. Abrahms and the viral marketing didn't happen this film would have went largely unnoticed and would have been barely memorable. Its carrying mostly on the crest of Abrahms 'Lost' wave but anyone with a little bit of common sense and their rose tinted Lost spectacles removed can see how much of a weak movie this is.Avoid.  SPOILER ALL THE WAY Where do I start.....Awful Camera Work. Seriously, do I want to spend money to watch a movie that looks like a 10 year old with a handy cam filmed it? This gimmick needs to die with this movie. It simply doesn't work, not the way they filmed this moviewreck.Screen Play by Comic Book writer? Seriously, who wrote this script? Skyscrapers leaning on skyscrapers? Girl with two foot steel bar going through her chest has it pulled out and continues on her merry way through collapsed leaning building, down the standing building it is leaning on, across town, to the subway, to the conveniently stumbled upon Military Hospital and finally, the escape helicopter, that CRASHES, and ends up at THE bridge. Yup, great writing skills here. Very creative.What were those little alien bugs and where did they come from?? Who cares. YAWN!! Dum. What else can I add or say about them. There are millions of them the little critters but somehow, our heroes manage to get by fighting off 1 or 2. Yes, 1 or 2. Too bad only one of the heroes gets bit. Oh, well, maybe not too bad, because we did get to know that you EXPLODE if you get bit as a result. YAWN!!! Who cares? What does it matter?This monster is something. You can't kill it for love of technology or big bombs. I love the monster scene at the very end. The camera guy gets eaten, boohoo. It should have happened in the first 30 seconds. Oh, the camera and his head survive, well, bitten off. Nice shot of the head in the grass because the camera falls and... focuses on the head, the grass, the head, the grass.... YAWN. And, our number one, romantic, brave hero guy with the girl friend who has a hole in her chest and has not yet bleed to death has the where-with-all to.... pick up the camera and keeps on recording until the nuke drops. YAWN!!!OH, this is no ordinary handy-cam!! No sir.... Spot Lights for lighting up dark subway tunnels, NIGHT VISION to see nasty bugs that are about to fall off the ceiling in the dark subway tunnel, batteries that run on nuclear power and last forever constantly filming and doing all the high tech search light stuff etc etc. And, how many times does the putz who is carrying it drop it, trip, fall down stair ways etc..... damaged?? No sir. I WANT THIS CAMERA.Plot.... right: Hero Guy meets girl. Hero Guy sleeps with girl. Hero Guy loves girl but doesn't call because he is going overseas to a new job. Girl comes to going away party with other guy. Heartache, lets talk, lets fight, lets eaves drop..... YAWN.Monster interrupts 20 something angst-party. Monster rips up city. Too bad it didn't eat everyone at the party. Well, he does. One at a time.Hero guy and party pals run and misplace some friends. Hey, it can happen.Hero guy NOW calls girl. (look, she gets misplaced and there is a lot going on! Don't ask me how, but it all happens in this handy cam fiesta.) But, he doesn't have a nuclear battery, like the one in the handy cam so before he calls, he has to go to an electronics store to steal a nuclear battery. Yessir!Where did the Girl go?? Girl went home to ground zero so she could be impaled by steel bar in half fallen, leaning skyscraper. Yes, she leaves the party during the Monster scene and goes back to her apartment in the confusion on the other side of town. Yes, the side with the monster. Come on, stay with the story line here!!Ring, Ring: HelloHero Guy: I love youGirl: oooooooh, I'm stuck under a building with a steel bar through my chest! I am faint and the line will go dead.... Now.Hero Guy: I'll save you. I love you. YAWN FEST.Hero guy drags all party friends to ground zero to remove girl from steel bar. Hey, it has to be done.They leave. What is a movie in New York without a subway scene. What is a movie in New York without monster buggy things in the subway scene. What is a Hollywood Gawd-Awful movie without a convenient chance arrival to a hospital. A party girl explodes due to monster-offspring-creepy-crawly bite while walking in subway. Hero guy and girlfriend with big bleeding hole-in-chest (but lots of blood to bleed) try to leave. Monster interrupts departure. Monster leaps up and grabs the escape helicopter. I saw it coming it was sooo obvious.Monster eats the camera guy. Best part of the movie because you hope your visual pain is over and you can now leave..... Nope. The Hero-Guy and Love Girl with still bleeding gaping hole in chest from big steel bar make it to a Bridge.Nuke drops. The End. The End. Really. Fade to Black. The movie just stops. Dead. Finished. 80 minutes or so.... OVER. Credits, leave the theater.You shake your head and wonder what the heck did you just waste your time paying to see.Save your money. This film needs to be bitten and chewed up and hope it explodes into the trash bin of moviewreck history. There will be a sequel, count on it. It will be as bad or worse.OH, I asked for my money back when I left the theater. Yes, I asked for my money back. Total and complete waste of time. After seeing the viral campaign with extremely well done fake news footage I had high hopes for this movie. I've always been a lover of the monster movie/horror genre...hell I even sort of enjoyed the Godzilla remake despite it's many failings and strong smell of cheese but Cloverfield? well what can I say...I went into watching this film knowing it was filmed entirely in a shaky "Blair Witch" cam style,but I didn't expect over an hour of motion sickness overkill.Unless you have taken the time to watch ALL of the viral marketing the first 20 minutes of the film are a COMPLETE waste of time.Don't get me wrong I don't expect any film like this to slap you in the face from minute 1 with monster attacks and carnage but the first 20 minutes would have made much more sense to those going in totally fresh if they would have spliced in some of the back story.Namely the reasons behind the career move and the company he was going to work for,the attack on the oil rig and possibly a teaser news clip before going into the final few minutes of the party and then the attack.I understand the idea behind having "amateur footage" but the film tries WAY to hard to get that idea over.Seriously I knew full well that it was supposed to be a handy cam after 5 minutes,they didn't need to vaguely wave the camera around every few minutes to get the point across.Yes this film has been compared to Blair Witch but Blair Witch had something that Cloverfield SERIOUSLY lacks...Ambiance.In Blair Witch even though you never see anything the off camera sounds give the film the mood it needs to drive the story and give the feeling of fear.Cloverfield simply doesn't have that and it leaves me feeling no compassion for the characters and no sense of danger unless they are in the open and within shouting distance of the monster(s) Simply put this movie is a love or hate experience,there isn't any middle ground.Although it's meant for the big screen I'd advise waiting till it's available for rent to avoid disappointment If you like screaming through the whole movie and a home movie effect where the camera holder is totally useless and cant stay upright or in perspective you MAY like this. Besides strobe like effects and completely ridiculous situations, ie: helicopter falls from 39 stories+ and only the 3 heroes survive, a 39 story building leaning on its opposite counterpart and the hero climbing stairs, crossing the roof, removing his live girlfriend from reo stuck through her chest and climbing down again while video is swaying to and fro? STUPID. Good effects if you can follow them and not a bad monster. Put me off the director for good I think. And I am a sci-fi nut. And what is "Cloverfield"? This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The camera was all shaky for most of the movie. The movie did not have a story line. The monster is destroying their city but it doesn't show why the monster is doing it or where the monster is from and how it got there without anyone noticing. I honestly don't know how anyone could like this movie it was GARBAGE. None of the movie was good. There was not even one good scene. I don't know how someone could make a movie that is so bad. All I can say is that seeing this movie is a waste of time and money. I was so mad during the whole movie. The monster was not even scary!! I don't recommend this movie to anyone!! I don't know why the director would even think about making a sequel because this movie was a waste of film. I don't even want to give this movie a one out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a ZERO out of ten ..it is way in the negatives. I never comment on movies, but this was just horrific. Not only does the filming make you sick to your stomach, but the actual movie was bad. They never explain what the monster is or how it came to be, they don't let you know what happens to the characters, nor do they give any follow up on anything. Horrible. People left the theaters so angry that they paid to see this piece of garbage, myself included. I'm so angry. I sat through the entire movie with my head in my hands because of the shaking camera, and besides that, the movie had no conclusion. It literally just ends. I am extremely disappointed and I feel cheated that I even invested $11.25 and almost 2 hours of my time. I saw this movie with my friends yesterday and I was so disappointed with it. First of all I had very low expectations of the movie because I had read forums about the movie thus knowing what to expect. Too bad the forums I was on had so many fan boys/girls that their views were somewhat tainted. Thus I know beforehand that the movie: (A) is a monster movie (B) it was shot through first person POV (C) it was about a group of young people's battle for survival.But I never expected the movie to lack a cohesive plot, empathetic characters and a good ending. I mean who in their right minds would rescue someone knowing that a monster is running amok trying to devour them all. OK, I understood Rob's reason a little bit (but it still is moronic) because he was in love. What was Lilly, Hud and that other girl's reason? I just don't get it. These characters defy the very rule of human nature: that is the need for self preservation.The movie also had a lot of loopholes. Some of them include a camcorder with an unlimited battery life, a person who is still filming even though they are in danger, and a girl who survives (and can very much run around) after being struck by a rod in the torso (?).I went inside the movie theater expecting at least some thrills here and there, but all I got was a lingering headache. All in all I hate hate hate this movie. Seeing how many trailers ran for this before it's release I was already worried this film was going to be truly awful. Anything getting hyped that much normally is awful. The film is all shot on hand-held cameras which is an incredibly bad idea. If Blair Witch taught us anything, it was hand-held cameras in a movie look abysmal! And this movie is no different.It's incredibly slow to get started, with no action until your 20 minutes into the film & that's where they jump the shark. If your in a building & just experienced an earthquake then on a roof to see an explosion & running downstairs from falling fireballs the VERY last thing your going to do is carry on filming at eye-level from a hand-held camera. Your either going to drop it or lower it down to waist height to allow yourself to run faster.And thats the kind of basic rookie mistake that ruins films. The bad hand-held camera work was already doing that anyway but a stupid goof like that killed the film before it ever got started. The people photographing the head of The Statue Of Liberty are just WAY too calm. There would be absolute hysteria, people would be going mental! As far all the destroyed buildings & falling rubble? In a post 9/11 climate is a movie with these images really a good idea or just incredibly stupid. The latter I feel.Rob getting a call from Beth on his cell phone? Highly unlikely after that kind of city devastation, lines would be restricted to emergency calls only. The scene on The Brooklyn Bridge is not believable at all. No-one seems frightened. Even when the bridge collapses the camera guy turns around to film whats happening. No-one would do that, you'd be too busy running away or getting trampled in the panic.When we finally do see bits of the monster it's an incredibly cheap looking effect. Even 1970's Dr Who would have been embarrassed about that thing. It looked like it cost all of $10, if that. A very cheap rubbery monster. A cheap Godzilla rip-off.Rob's motivation for rescuing Beth is zero. They had a huge argument at the party and he was upset when she left. His mood towards her suddenly changing is incredibly suspect & a very POOR plot device. The soldiers they encountered, not 1 said get down (before they started firing), not 1 said turn back. It just wouldn't happen. The plausibility of the movie just gets less & less by the scene.You also have to question Hud not knocking Rob out by the time their in the subway. Even truly good friends would have punched his lights out by then. As for "walking the tunnels"? If there's a light on the camera, why isn't Hud walking at the front so everyone behind him can see? As far as them being attacked by those creatures? The movie should have ended right there because they were outnumbered & should have all been killed.The way they just suddenly meet the soldiers is far too simple. Marlena dies (even though you never see anything, she's bleeding from her eyes then is taken behind a curtain where you see an explosion of blood so its safe to assume she's VERY dead).With Rob saying to the soldier "If you want to stop me you'll have to shoot me", the soldier should have pulled out his gun and done us ALL a favour. Even after seeing Beth's building half knocked down Rob STILL thinks she's alive? I'm sorry but 1 of the 2 remaining friends would have actually knocked him out cold at that point.After pulling Beth off the spike, why wasn't she bleeding like crazy? Also the awful & incredibly predictable scare when the monster hits the helicopter? And they survive the crash? I think at this point in the movie they had run out of ideas & were just doing anything to kill time.Hud gets an excellent death (bitten in half by the monster) & then you get Rob & Beth talking to the camera, an explosion, rubble falling, Coney Island then nothing. No ending, no resolution? And to those who think they saw a splash in the sea at the end? It's a ship sailing from left to right, certainly nothing splashing into the sea like so many claims I've read. What an awful film. From start to lack of finish, utter garbage! Not recommended to anyone, ever. I assume that the target market for this movie is people who missed Blaire Witch, all 20+ Godzilla movie, and who have not yet gotten enough of the images of the 911 tragedy. For those viewers this may seem like a fresh and exciting experience. For the rest of us it is an utter failure of creativity and film making.I was advised to state that my comments on Cloverfield amount to a spoiler. So... Warning : spoiler. But I actually question if there is a spoiler to this film. I personally think in retrospect of having seen the movie, that the trailer is completely honest. The only thing hidden in the trailer is the exact shape of the "entity" that beheads the statue of liberty. What the heck is"Cloverfield"? It's simple "Cloverfield" is a terrible movie.Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. This is a cheap rip off film which can be best summarized as "blaire witch" meets "godzilla" and with an overdose of post-911 fear thrown in. Why induce 911 references and play of that remaining fear? Because this movie is so lame that it needs cheap references to 911 to get any excitement going what so ever. The only good thing you can say is that it is short - only 80 minutes long. But even at 80 minutes it is way too long. I found myself yawning with boredom. No amount of special effects or jerky camera work can save this snoozer.But a boring horror/scifi film might just end up being simply bad or average. Not Cloverfield. The thing that raises Cloverfield to the status of terrible movie is that it is so incredibly, completely, utterly unoriginal. Blaire Witch was not a great film - it was however original and creative - if annoying and slightly nauseating due to jerky camera action. It used low budget techniques to tell a scary story. Like it or not there was creative thought and originality in that film. It made the most of low tech.In 1954 Ichiro Honda's Gojira, ゴジラ (Godzilla for the US release), was a ground breaking film that inspired an entire genre of films, spoke to the horrors of the atomic age, decried the racist occupation of Japan, and honestly foreshadowed the horrors of the 911 attacks. Filmed on shoe string budget in post war Japan, Gojira in it's original uncut 90 minute release was a remarkable and chilling film. Honda used low tech effects to create moving and terrifying cautionary tale of retribution for the horrors of nuclear war. Though modern audiences now jaded by overwhelming overused special effects may have difficulty connecting with the special effects of 1954, Gojira still stands up, and still sends a chill down the spine. The opening credits, from a completely black screen bold white characters burst forth with the awesome roar of Gojira and the rumble of giant foot steps. In 2008 that roar and those foot steps assaulting the silence of the theatre still inspire real fear. One can only imagine the effect on audiences of 1954.What does Cloverfield inspire? Boredom and nausea. Nausea not born of anxiety - but rather motion sickness from jerky camera work. Warning! This movie will make you motion sick! So a movie that is completely unoriginal. A movie that shamelessly steals it premise from two well known movies. That's pretty terrible. Add to that the fact that the main characters are undeveloped, unlikable, and incredibly stupid, and you have a stunningly bad movie.Since I have a personal interest in movies about giant monsters who flatten cities I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing something original. Such a premise offers the possibility of a mystery or a surprise... or some clever twist that would pay tribute to the original - the great Gojira. An homage? I mean it seemed so obvious that there was some unknown monster out there tearing up the city - so obvious that no one in their right mind could simply leave it at that - especially after all the hype. Maybe Gojira would show up. There had to be more right? Right? Wrong. I guess all the remakes - Godzilla vs Rodan, vs, Mothra, vs Monster X, All monsters must Die, Godzilla 2000 - just slipped the minds of the producers - is that it? No this movie is exactly what it is - there is no surprise. Giant monster attacks New York. Buildings crash into clouds of dust that leave New Yorkers coughing and staggering about the post apocalyptic streets were they get eaten. (Oh yeah - plan on seeing a reference to two other famous horror films - "Alien" and "The Thing") Sheets of office paper flutter through the sky a la 911 footage. Cloverfield is a completely predictable and entirely derivative film that is driven by a highly choreographed well executed marketing campaign - that's all. I went to see Cloverfield with very high expectations; the trailers had got my attention, and I enjoyed "Lost" which had the same writer. I was expecting something that was fresh, original, with a decent storyline and quality dialog.Unfortunately, this film was a huge disappointment; it offered none of the above. The story is told from the viewpoint of one of the characters that has a hand-held camcorder, and as a consequence the pictorial style of the movie is very similar to "Blair Witch", e.g. jerky camera shots in an attempt to make the film more "realistic". Unfortunately, this becomes extremely annoying after 15 minutes or so, and as a ploy to make the audience think they watching an amateur recording it is totally destroyed by the incredible sound quality, supposedly from the same source.In addition, there isn't a storyline as such; some people are having a party, and a destructive creature suddenly appears and trashes the city they are in. There is no explanation of where the creature came from, or what it is. It's a pure lift from any Godzilla movie. The rest of the movie is simply watching the jerky camcorder follow the characters (albeit with incredible sound quality) through the city as first they try to escape, and then have to turn back to find the true love of one of the characters. Yes, it really *is* that clichéd.After that, the storyline (what is left of it) gets steadily more and more ridiculous. The characters go into a subway and are attacked by face hugger outtakes from "Aliens". The army take them into custody, but instead of evacuating them they let them go because - hey! - the male lead is going back to find his true love. So much for realism ;) The girl they're looking for is trapped in a tower block that has been attacked by the alien, and which is collapsing, but which has conveniently not fallen over completely but just come to lean against another tower block... the same as you see in any war zone - NOT. When they climb the tower to find the girl, she is pinned down by a steel rod through her shoulder. However, they pull her free, and despite the resultant blood loss she is soon running around the city like a spring chicken trying to escape. Again, so much for realism ;) The key fault with Cloverfield is that is it an unholy marriage of two totally conflicting styles; the realistic, camcorder style of "Blair Witch" that records the relationship between the characters, and the desire to use that same style to give some indication of the enormity of the alien that is destroying the city. It simply doesn't work, specially when it is hampered by a script that becomes more and more implausible by the minute.Cloverfield has no outstanding dialog, no character development, no plausible plot line, and no sense of realism. The special effects are reasonable, but they weren't what I came to see. It really is that bad, and I wasn't the only one to think so. At the end of showing I went to, there was a stunned silence, and then people started laughing... in disbelief that they'd sat and watched such a pile of rubbish.This is easily a candidate for the worst film of 2008. Cloverfield is the type of film that asks so much from its audience and delivers so little. Right from the start it basically gets down on its hands and knees begging and pleading everyone to take it seriously.It tells you to excuse the bad camera work which tries desperately at times to cover up the next thing it asks you to ignore, the pathetic acting abilities of all the unknown actors involved.Then we get to the story (if one could call it that) and the tissue paper thin plot. We begin at a going away party in New York for this guy Rob that gets interrupted by rumblings and explosions in the distance which which are being caused by some sort of monster. So then Rob, his cameraman and friends start heading out of New York when Rob gets a call from a girl (Beth) that he slept with one time, apparently is in trapped in her apartment. So Rob decides to go and save her and his friends for tag along for the ride. To quickly sum up, one by one all our main characters die either by a big monster, a little monster or an explosion.The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of a hand-held camera which for some reason has the longest battery life I've ever seen, and somehow is able to still function properly despite being dropped a couple of times and survive a helicopter crash.Overall, Cloverfield is filled with people pretending to be actors, A boring story with little or no explanation of much of anything, and one indestructible video camera.It is clear that the marketing campaign was where the majority of the budget for this movie went as this film was all hype and no substance. The hype for this movie was caused it go to the top of the box office in its first week and when word spread of how bad the film truly was, it sunk at box office falling in 5 weeks from 1st to 4th to 9th to 12th and the out of the top 20.If you really hated this movie as I did, check out rifftrax.com home of our friends from Mystery Science Theater who know a thing or two about bad movies.
