Every part of this movie is useless, absolutely boring. story is hilarious, and the characters are all useless and unneeded.Sure they put in a chick in a short skirt and a dog and we feel something, but the script is meaningless. The only saving grace for this mince is that Ana De Armas is in it. All you fools who are just discovering her know nothing. She's a goddess. FACT! BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big "plot twist" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big "twist" is mentioned as the "miracle", but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did "that" might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable "obedience" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more "like humans". On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the "original" Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage. I didn't realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. "And what can your maker do for you?".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannot remember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which made the original the best sci-fi movie ever. I take the same view as Rutger Hauer recently did. Why even try to do a second one? It would be as painting a second Mona Lisa. Or building another Eiffel tower.A huge disappointment of a sequel that should never have been made. The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in the company of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinema feeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonous film. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just going from place to place to investigate something like in a video game. At the beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basically indestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out any suspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable, the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it had atmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot of emptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solid light fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from a small device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why are they so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production when they are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped with holographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TV quality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technology jump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the most important parts of the original. He conveyed through the use of synthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder, beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson was originally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of done a great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywood sounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. It might as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loud noise. The original was a box office failure that became a cult classic. This is just a failure. i cannot believe these ten star comments, first the visuals were mostly flat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually no people around, one scene only with about thirty extras, no lights seems to be on either in the shots were he is flying over the city. more importantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in less than an hour. nothing happens for most of the film. it is as if all concerned were on valium. the music was just noise. talk about an anti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. none of the very little plot made any sense. so here we have yet again critics raving about nothing. an insult to the original in every way. do not waste your time or money going to see this. i was going to list the many non-sensical things in the film but on reflection i don't think the film deserves anymore of my time In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn't rebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a Runaway Nexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus 8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discover the bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along with the realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason. I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Deckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone's confused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie. (Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is a replicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient than just growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicants to colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty of people living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this movie was. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea what made it a good movie. Admittedly, I did not enjoy the prospects of a Blade Runner sequel, since I considered the first installment to be a one-off story, for which a sequel would ultimately harm.Unfortunately, this movie did just that. I did not like the plot at all, which I considered both ridiculous and tacky, despite being drenched in massive amounts of self-importance. The visuals were nice, and lots of care seemed to be made to maintain the original's style. The problem is, again, the story, narrative, etc. I'd say it's worth a watch, but I don't believe many will return for a second viewing This movie was so bad I can't put into words. I loved Blade Runner but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original. Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and not in a good wayAs people left the theater I saw shaking heads.Don't understand people raving about it. They must be connected to the film somehow. Save your money, watch the original and don't let this ruin it for you like it did for me What a damn slow motion movie. Not a single thing good about it. Poor acting and baseless action scenes making it much worse. Thought it will have some wow moments being a sci fi film but I was utterly disappointed. Beware of the fake ratings and it's totally not worth it. I loved original but I have to say I really hated this one. From movie music score to plot and cinematography - everything was a disappointment. The music score (loud noise) and cinematography was especially heavy handed in trying to force drama when it was not warranted by plot. Instead of so much CGI producers should have spent some $ on a better script and director. A bad movie should not be this long, people walked out at my showing. I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The only thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over. I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen. Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it. Watched it last night. We had high expectations from this movie based on the first one. It is so slow in the beginning that we already started to lose interest in the first half hour of play. We showed some understanding taking into consideration how long the movie was. My mates and I ended up sleeping sometime through the movie. This is the first time such thing has ever happened to us so you can understand how bad it was. The second half was a bit more interesting. Nothing more than dragging the plot and all those stupid unnecessary sounds woke us up every now and then. In overall it's a 163 minute masterpiece of crap. I'm sickened by the fawning over this spectacularly empty drivel.So utterly characterless for something purporting to reflect on the nature of human consciousness. No character = no script, of course. The original revels subtly in the exploration of how identity and memory are intrinsic to one another. How the objects we surround ourselves persuade us of our identity. Gosling's apartment in contrast, characterless. Literally. There is no character that lives there. Perhaps they feared that a character, with an actually believable life, in the film might detract from the computerised holographic eye candy companion? Did Harvey Weinstein have some say in this element? This avatar of desire has potential for commentary, but resolves as an astonishing endorsement of computerised companionship as a viable alternative to human relationship. In our dystopian future, as the capacity for community dissolves, this is our great hope; the post prostitute/hologram wife sex - "coffee?" - results in smiles all round.  This element to the film made me a little physically sick and highly sympathetic to militant feminism. The film's clumsy attempts at visual poetry pale into comparison with the original - proving the point that the soul of the work is what creates a spectacle with substance, not computing power.Jared Leto's Kurtz impression might have fared better had their been any craft in the script. Perhaps if they'd gotten Rutger Hauer to improvise some lines there'd have been some semblance of originality, instead of memorable quotes such as "You do not know...pain."The score to the movie was effective, but lacked the nuanced, cohesive beauty of Vangelis' offering in the original; of course it suffers from the hodge podge on screen. There can be no artistic combinatorial explosion when so many elements are lacking in subtlety, originality...spirit. This deficit being exemplified by the Power Rangers finale...PEOW PEOW - HIIIIYA!!!And there is no spirit. This post-modern parable embodies and endorses the pseudo-scientific reductionist view of humanity as essentially worthless and doomed. It is an unrelentingly shallow and joyless indulgence with plot holes you could drive a bus through (it's a real memory... then it must be mine! *BOOOOM* - great work detective!). To give the team the benefit of the doubt, let's say that some elements may be excused by the use of focus groups by the studios. It wouldn't take much to alter the attitude of Gosling to his 3D spouse to highlight to the viewer the 1D nature of his relationship. Maybe those takes are on the cutting room floor, maybe there'll be a superior director's cut. I doubt it'll be any the better, the changes needing to be radical; including shaving about an hour off the running time.Perhaps the director's cut will appear before the sequel. Yes, thanks to the introduction of a rebellion, we can look forward to the Matrix style "Bladerunner reloaded", "Bladerunner revolutions"...I wonder whether Netflix or Amazon will make the series? #justanotherfranchiseIn the year 2019, I believe this effort will suffer horribly from hindsight; unlike the majestic original...and we'll always have the original. A memory of exemplary filmic storytelling, indelibly etched in my mind forming part of my identity, available for generations to come...1* What a bore.The film felt like it went on for a lot longer than it actually was, and with a very thin plot stretched out for 2 hours and 40 minutes. It would have been quicker to read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K Dick, which influenced the original film.The imagery and special affects are spectacular. The sound track is clearly influenced by the original film and was quite good. The film didn't get anywhere near the atmosphere of the 1982 film.There were times when it was hard to hear some of the dialogue but as most of that dialogue was pointless waffle that wasn't too much of an issue. There were long scenes of dull silence followed by long scenes of needless chatter, all with no action or interest.I got so bored watching this I counted 17 people leave the screen in the last hour of the film who didn't return.Ryan Gosling (K) was mostly poor throughout the film. A small tree in a leather jacket could have played that role just as well.Ana de Armas (Joi) stood out amongst the cast as K's hologram love interest, backed by spectacular computer imagery.Jered Leto played Niander Wallace, for some reason. His scenes were amongst the longest and most tedious. They went on and on with the dullest dialogue in the whole film.I since found out that Director Denis Villeneuve is also responsible for Sicario and Arrival. If I'd known beforehand I wouldn't have bothered going to see the third film in his 'Trilogy of Tripe'.Don't go out of your way to see this. Stay at home and watch the 1982 original, it's so much better. The original blade runner had gritty street-scenes that were immersive and set the stage for believing, imagining, and then becoming immersed in the context of a dystopian future. In terms of grit, nothing from the original movie survived into the current production. The characters in the sequel are vapid (caricatures) in comparison to the original movie. Tyrell was a thoughtful genius, Roy was passionately fighting his own pre programmed mortality ,Pris could not find humanity, and Leon was locked into the anger of his past, Sebastian was captive to his own body. Then there was Rachel who was searching for personage and Decker for purpose. NONE of that kind of character developing can be found in this sad excuse for amovie.This movie was a shell, a sham, they even had a shell of a Pris character. A total vapid, barren, antiseptic, drubbed down, and dull waste. This movie did not even have the decency to have any grit. That Ridley Scott had anything to do with this is a surprise. The music: what music?The sound effects? Every bump and nose wipe was a 10 on the theater sound system Richter scale. A little subtlety would go a long way in improving every aspect of the effects. A good story? Please.The interminable "dramatic" hold scene?. Good grief. They made up half the screen time.The story? It's finally revealed in the last half hour as a remake of the Da Vinci Code. And poorly. Sorry guys. How this got an IMDb rating of 8.7 on day one is as big a mystery as, well, anything in the last 8 months of life in the USA. Yuk. This came out to be a 2+ hours of pretentious garbage. Ranging from a retarded-soulless dialogue to an annoyingly-monotonous sound track, from the simplistically-cliché plot to the bland-jelly-fish color scheme. Everything is gutless in this pile of failure, especially the chubby sequel-implying ending.Villeneuve is such a try-hard. He just doesn't have the talent. He desperately tries to make up for this lack of talent with shallow long shots, meaningless misplaced close-ups, long pauses that lack tension and just about every other cliché he could find in the book but inevitably failed to execute the intended appeal, which resulted in all of his movies being torturous experiments on the viewer. This one is no exception.Villeneuve is the ironic master of boring and flat movies. He couldn't have made a good movie if his life depended on it. Beats me why he is praised so much. I wouldn't hire the guy to cut my lawn.Seriously, if you want to waste 2 hours of your time - watch it. But I guarantee, you will not want to watch it again.This crap MUST NOT be associated with Philip K. Dick's work. This film is garbage.Over long, muddled, confused, boring, with no likable characters.The story-as far as I can decipher-relates to a woeful future time when replicants/robots seek to destroy earlier models.But of course the film tries to dictate to us that there being no substitute for humans... the problem with that preaching is that it was, I assume, a human who made this total nonsense of a movie!What is just as bad as the blandness of this picture is that many so called professional film reviewers are writing treatises etc., on how wonderful is this film.The fact- as opposed to the science fiction- is that this flick is a disaster and an abject mess:1/10 This is the first review I have written for a movie and the reason I am writing this is because this is the worst movie I have ever seen. About 45 minutes into the movie I asked my husband if he understood what was going on and he did not either. Not only is it difficult to understand what is going on, but it is dark and slow. (many scenes of the characters holding their hand out into the fake snow, looking at their hands. or long shots of the characters staring off into space.) The only color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaves were shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreed he was glad it was over. I suppose that it gets high reviews because of the special effects, but without a story line that is interesting and engaging, special effects do nothing for me. Movie is too long. Story is way too simple. Maybe the director think there is twist but it is definitely not. A bit of everything while not successful in any part of it. Using CGI in sex part. How it is relevant to the story? Sony logo is everywhere. A completely waste of time. Don't watch it. The original Blade Runner is one of my top favorites of all time, and I personally have over 500 DVDs in my collection, of which over 50 are from the science fiction genre. I don't know what Kool-aid other reviewers have been drinking, but this was one of the most tedious, pretentious, boring, meaningless, poorly acted, loudest,dumbest movies I have ever experienced. After enduring 2 hours and 32 minutes, I did something I rarely do: I walked out during the ending titles. That's all folks! I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expect awful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which was innovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original was stellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel (which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslings character was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. Jared Leto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small but interesting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You notice I haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old man mode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least I this that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy but that music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California but the sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene I kept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missed opportunity to make an interesting sequel. It was a mental sufferfest to watch this to the end. The original movie was exciting and flowed. This movie was all over the place, almost like there was a massive fight in the cutting room and what they ended up with was submitted to meet a deadline .I saw it in 3D as well but I found the visual fx were just OK. Nothing out of the ordinary.I'm wondering where they spent the money here. I would advise them to spend it on an expert story 'fixer' next time rather than release this tosh!In a word: awful. I would implore people to really consider what type of movie they like before going to see this one. The slowness of the movie and non-verbal communication and overall "take 5 minutes to illustrate what usually can be done effectively and more atmospherically in 30seconds to 1min" is absolutely rampant in this movie. Ryan Gosling is wooden and hardly communicates, the Harrison Ford addition is also mediocre. It's quite simple, i ended up walking out of the movie as did 20-25% of the entire audience. Overall the most disappointing movie i have seen in years ... it could have been so, so, so much more! So, £85 million well spent? I guess since they've already made more than double that back, then from a financial point of view - Yes! But as a film....Frankly I would rather remove one of my own limbs with a blunt hacksaw, then eat it raw before I watched this again. 2.5 hours of some of the most boring drivel, bad acting, weak special effects and irritating children you could hope to come across. The sooner these "Child Stars" descend into a drug and sodomy filled adolescence the better for all concerned.Yes I have read the books, and yes, I enjoyed them, but this is still one of the dullest films I've ever encountered. Sticking to the original story is one thing, but when the audience are left praying for the last 5 chapters to be cut, something's gone wrong.Back to my original point - where did the £85 million go? The Quidditch match was about on a par with King Kong for realism, and using Fungus the Bogeyman for the Troll was a masterpiece of imagination-free modelling. Perhaps all the money went on getting the magic tricks to look right? Or maybe not. How much effort does it take to have some brat wave his wand, the camera cuts away, comedy explosion sound effect, then camera cuts back to child with spiky hair and blackened face? Pure genius! They really have pushed back the boundaries of comedy here.All in all I feel cheated out of 2.5 hours of my life, and I strongly recommend that you don't fall into the same trap. If you have 2.5 hours that you really want rid of, then I'd suggest spending it slowly rubbing sandpaper over your eyeballs - it's cheaper, and more pleasant on the senses. This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. "I'm a wizard!" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10 I have not read any Harry Potter books.  Be that as it may, when the glowing reviews started to come in for this film I decided to take a look at it.  I cannot comment on the translation from book to film or the quality of Rowling's books but the film of the very first novel is quite horrible.  I tried to like it, but I found it excruciating to watch.  It took me no where and, even worse, it really didn't have much of a plot.  The thin shreds of plot were introduced 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film.  The first part of the film was obviously conceived to give a background to the viewer of the Potter world.  Unfortunately there was little to grip me here and I found most of it to be grossly out of place.  What the heck does a game of "Quidditch" have to do with the story?  It, and many other things, were just eye candy.  The characters were stale and seemed like rejects from a Roald Dahl story (see James and the Giant Peach).  I'm flabbergasted that such a piece of junk has attracted so many adamant fans.  No wonder kids don't know how to read or write very well anymore.  No wonder Britney Spears and N'Sync are so possible.  The piece of trash that is Harry Potter explains it all - the current generation will cling to anything as long as they don't have to think for themselves.  'Tis a pity. 2 1/2 hours of Boredom. Half the audience fell asleep, including most of the kiddies. Beautiful to look at, but that does not make for a interesting film. Rather spend your money on Lord of the Rings. Why all the glowing comments?  This is one lame movie.  Haven't we seen these types of special effects enough already?  The acting was lame.  The story was lame.  The pace was slow.  The scenes overly long and trite.  I was bored out of my mind.  I don't really think that most children would honestly like the movie very much except for the fact that it's been hyped so much.  They probably have collected all the toys and such that go along with the marketing of this drivel.  It looks to me that the overly positive reviews are from those that are a part of the sheep syndrome that is sweeping the nation.  Join the flock or be an outcast?  Sorry, I'm not so easily led...this is one lame movie.I feel so bad for Richard Harris.  One of his last roles and it had to be this weak character.  He's probably had worse rolls, but this certainly is not one to be proud of.  Big beards do not make a character wise or strong. Alan Rickman's character was by far the best played one. 
I'll rate this 1/10 because of the pretentiousness of the whole thing. Sorry kids, this one does suck. Warning: there may be spoilers ahead. Not like it matters, because the whole movie is rotten anyway, and you're better off not seeing it.I really don't get what kids like so much about this drivel. The main problem is that the characters are not likable. Not that they are dislikeable, they are just flat and bland like altar bread. And they don't change at all from the beginning to the end. Who's to blame - the bad actors, the mediocre director, or the awful writer? Really, I've seen far better character development in "Revenge of the Nerds".And the story is just dumb. It starts with a good point: a kid with magical powers. Where did I hear that before? Oh, of course: "The Books of Magic". Except for the fact that JK Rowling is no Neil Gaiman... but anyway, here's an example. When Potter's magic powers first appear, he never seems to be too puzzled by them, never gets scared, nor thinks about using them to exact revenge from his cruel family. Hello? Anyone there ever read "X-Men"? If you suddenly get super-human powers, you must be puzzled and tempted!Talking about cruel families... they can be excellent plot devices. Green Goblin, anyone? But Potter seems to be immune to a decade of humiliation. Sure, he is quite lethargic (or is it bad acting?), but is never aggressive or rancorous. Which makes no sense.There are lots of other bad scenes, like the ridiculous chess scene. Remember that scene of "Attack of the Clones" that was sometimes mockingly described as 'Star Wars meets Megaman'? This is similar, but even worse. There's no sensible reason for this place to exist, yet it does. Even if the rest of the movie was not a disgrace, that scene alone would have ruined it. Any suspension of disbelief that had survived the previous awfulness of the movie was killed at that exact moment.Bad acting, bad directing, bad visual effects, bad music, and - above anything else- the bad writing... with all these problems, this movie ends up bland like drinking warm water. It has absolutely no flavor - but it can still make you want to throw up. This film is simply awful, the acting is a joke. Being a fan of the book I decided to buy the DVD without seeing at the cinema or renting it before, but I was extremely dissapointed. Daniel Radcliff's acting is terrible, in my honest opinion he was only hired because he looks like the illustrations of Harry Potter and he is definatly what I had pictured in my mind but his acting makes a mockery out of the film and turns it into a spoof of the book, instead of bringing it to life. I definatly won't be rushing to the shops to get the second film too soon. ***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** As an adult, it didn't appeal to me in the least. The effects were poorly done, the giant plot leap in the middle ("lots of strange things are happening-- hey, I know! it's definitely because the creepy teacher guy wants the thing under the trap door under the three-headed dog") threw me completely out of the story. It's really a kids only movie, which disappointed me, because I'd been hearing such good things about it. And then at the end, Harry is sent back to his abusive adoptive parents. So much for changing one's situation.And I know that they had to cut tremendous amounts of story in order to make it only 2 1/2 hours long (which was still way too long for this movie). After waiting in line outside the theater with tickets bought a week ahead of time, I must say I was truly disappointed. I'm even more saddened by the commercial success and the lunacy of die hard Harry Potter fans which will keep this sad and poorly-written movie in theaters much longer than it needs to be.Some books should remain books. Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story.  That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character. It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun.  If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.  In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy. Literally anyone could write this story. Nothing is original, the effects are mostly bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the music score was written by John Williams 25 years ago (if you get my meaning).This movie isn't funny enough, dark enough or smart enough to be considered interesting. It's very simple and too boring.The studio executives have gone really stupid nowadays; the original and interesting ideas are never promoted, they always seem to go for the safe (meaning stupid) bet.1/10 terribly contrived and juvenile.  From the outset, it treats viewers like they were little children - the problem is, that most children won't realize how terrible it is because they haven't the breadth of experience to notice how contrived and unoriginal the plot is.I don't blame Columbus though, JK Rowling has created a cliched story full of unoriginality and character shallowness.  The fact that Harry Potter seems to be everybody's favourite and is virtually invincible in the film just makes you feel sick at how predictable this film is.And the ending - my gosh, what a terrible ending.  Star Wars was bad enough with their super proton topedoes that destroy whole mother ships (and stupid Darth Vader never learnt the lesson of having such weaknesses from his experience in The Phantom Menace).  But Harry Potter tops it with it's ridiculous ending whose sole explanation is a mother's love? Ludicrous!Go see a real movie, from the original genius of JRR Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings. In 2001, the Harry Potter posters were everywhere in Hong Kong. I decided to go to the movie. However, I was very disappointed. I did not understand what the movie is about until I read the book. I think J. K. Rowling did a good job in writing the story but the movie makes no sense at all. All the plots are not linked up. The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad. The entire movie is not bad but very very very bad.If you want to learn about the Harry Potter stories, go straight ahead to the book, but definitely not the movie. At first I liked the Harry Potter series, it was imaginative, it was original, it was funny, and it had promise. Then the second one came out, "oh WOW this is heaven, it can't get better than this", then the third came out, "I was wrong about the second, because this is awesome". Then in between finishing the third and the release of the fourth I read the Lord of the Rings. And shortly after, the movies for both came out. I realized the huge difference, I was psyched out when I heard they were making a Harry Potter movie, but there they go and ruin it. Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in "Mrs. Doubtfire", and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching "Power Rangers". I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained. Here's one buck the woman won't get her hands on. About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out.  It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.
The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as it is called everywhere else besides the US, and I'd like to know why, is no more than a 5th rate failure at best.  Now I know I'm probably enraging every single person who has read the novel, however this movie is not the novel.  Book and Film are two totally different mediums.  Something that works in a novel, wont decessarily work on the big screen.  Harry Potter is the greatest example of that.Colombus decided to change very, very little in his adaptation of the novel, which is the movie's greatest fault.  An author has the luxury to spend pages and pages describing a certain image in a story; a film does not have that kind of luxury.  The movie was terribly boring due to the fact that Colombus tried to pace the movie the same way as the book.  That is an impossible feat.  The movie is not meant to be some companion to the novel. If that was the truth, then the 7 billion people who havent read the novel wouldnt even bother showing up to watch.  A movie is supposed to have a broad audience in order to make money, if Colombus feels that he is only making the movie to please Potter fans, then AOL Time Warner will have a huge failure on their hands.  I've never read the book, and some may say that that is the reason why I didnt enjoy the movie.  But again, I went to see a movie, not read a book.  The Godfather is not a classic because it stayed true to Puzo's novel.  It is a classic because Coppola knew what elements would need to be changed in order to make the book filmable. Colombus doesnt have a clue.The only thing good about Harry Potter was the cinematography.  Most of the film looked brilliant, especially Hogwarts itself.  Yet, a visually pleasing film does not make the film suddenly good.  It doesnt even come close.  The effects are just a testament to the fact that Colombus got his priorities way wrong when he filmed this boring, plodding paced movie.  I voted it a one, I was feeling generous. Ouch. This film irritated me so much I was in tortuous pain by the end of it. I only really have one reason for despising this film, but this reason is so monumental in its power that it caused me to spend much of the film writhing around on the carpet in agonising spasms, spasms from which I am only just beginning to recover. The reason ladies and gentlemen, is terrible child acting.The three kids, in particular the girl, are guilty of some of the most trite, sickly sweet overacting ever seen on the silver screen. They reminded me of primary school plays where the most precocious kids in the class are given the leading roles rather than those with any semblance of charisma or acting ability. They somehow fail in portraying any tangible or believable emotion whatsoever. They do however succeed in over-pronouncing every single letter of every syllable of every word as if the Lord of Language himself (possibly Stephen Fry) were watching over them ready to strike them down in the event of a missing 't' in sweet or a missing 'g' in bloody annoying. It is the cinematic equivalent of Maria Carey warbling up and down through every conceivable note in order to try and prove that she can sing; but in doing so exhibiting a pretentiousness that has no place on this earth.My unofficial award for worst acting performance is currently held by the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace, but these three run him very close indeed.Someday I will get around to reviewing the film's plot and characters but only when the agony and nausea are fully extinguished from my limbs and I can once again look out upon the world with the asceticism and joyful exuberance that have become my trademark. Good day. I've read the book only to see what all the hype's about. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very easy book to follow and dares to be nothing more than it actually is - a plain old nothing-new-under-the-sun children's book. In that, Rowling did a fine job. Snippets from Lord of the Rings, Dracula, Ender's Game, to name a few, were bluntly used throughout the book and meshed together to form this trashy, 2 cents of a fantasy story. Oh well, as long as it keeps my children reading.But the movie... oh, well, now that's plain sad. I don't recall ever seeing such forced adaptation of a book to a movie. Everything about this movie is wrong. The younger actors act so bad they seem to take part of some sorry school play, the CG effects are ridiculously unrealistic, the script is just a scribble of the original book's text rather than telling an actual story. And the list goes on.The fact that Rowling insisted on having only British actors seem to have been the first mine laid on a shaggy path to a bearable movie. Steven Spielberg (who was offered the job) could have done a much better job in directing just as much as Haley Joel Osment (6th Sense, who was suggested by Spielberg for the part) could have been a MUCH more convincing Harry Potter. A whole lot of the experience was missed, as the rest was brutally murdered by idiotic idealism by the author. Plain sad.The worst part is that such a horror of a movie had earned so much money to its makers. Kinda blows away all wishes of becoming a good, hard-working director... it seems that skill has nothing to do with success. :)It deserves nothing more than 1/10. If you want a quick and easy way to punish your kids take them to see  Harry Potter. This overlong and boring movie will put them to sleep.  The acting was economy class at best and the plot stank worse than a  moldy anchovie sandwich. The only good thing to come out of the movie  is the undeniable talent of Robbie Coltrane. To bad the man wasted his  talents on this piece of trash.  Chris Columbus just can't direct and newcomer Daniel Radcliffe can't  act. The special effects were actually pretty decent for the film.  I would give this movie 0/10 but there is no zero on the voting so I  had to give it a one. First off I'll start on the basics that others have mentioned. The acting is bad from the three child-actors. I thought this might be because they were so young but I've seen the fifth film and it still doesn't improve. Their acting is on a "school play" level with over-emphasised lines and facial expressions. Daniel Radcliffe was chosen for this film because he looks like the character but by the fifth film he no longer looks like him. The silly glasses make this slightly better but it's a cheap effect. The ginger kid was annoyance personified and I could write an essay on his irritating habits. I detest the way he uses soft swear words like bloody with that fake working class accent. The girl overdid the "goody goody girl" role.The fact that they were friends from the start and stayed together the whole time was so unbelievable, by the fifth film they're still all together mainly. Rowling obviously copied this from other children's books but it doesn't make it any more believable. Those sort of "group" friendships never happen in school in real life."Harry Potter"? Couldn't she have thought of a better name. Only "John Smith" would have been more generic. A book or film in which the main character is called Harry Potter could be about anything. When I first heard about the books and the plot i.e. a boy who goes to wizard school, I immediately thought that it was just a copy of "The Worst Witch" by Jill Murphy. That book is more consistent, has better characters and is a true pleasure to read as a child. Regardless, Rowling's ideas have been done so many times before. I tried Harry Potter and I found it unreadable, how anyone could actually enjoy reading this pap is beyond me. The only explanation of why the books are so popular is because of media hype. The series came about just at the right time and was lucky in that the media and publishing companies were looking for something to hype so as to make a lot of money because the series is so generic and plagiarised it's not even funny.Other characters were generic too. Robbie Coltrane's character is a standard in many children's books. He's the big, burly gentle giant grounds keeper or whatever who, although being big and strong, is actually very gentle, kind and becomes a friend to the children. The worst thing about this character though his his clichéd west-country accent. Arghhh! It's just so predictable! DumbleBORE is also generic: he's the wise old wizard who is both kind and tough but fair. He even has the big old white beard which practically every wizard in literature also has. There's also the supposed obvious "evil" character played by Alan Rickman who surprise surprise turns out not to be evil after all. Was that the big "twist" of the film/book? Good Lord, this must be aimed at the 50-90 IQ range. Harry's nemesis is a sort of young blonde Dracula lookalike who also can't act. His badness is never explained, it's obviously hoped by the producers that the watcher will not question why he's Harry's nemesis and just accept that he looks bad, does bad, says bad and that's that.The story itself lacks imagination regarding the characters (see above), the setting and the plot. Rowling manages to incorporate a large number of overused mythical creatures and objects which causes the story to feel as though a child wrote it to include all her little fantasies. Everyone seems to ride brooms, even the men and boys despite that only witches traditionally rode them (she even gets that wrong); potions are brewed in cauldrons and it's never explained why potions are needed when wands seem able to do everything. I just don't get this "magic" thing (perhaps it be because I'm a "muggle", ugh horrid cutesy word makes me cringe). Magic seems in large to replace the need for modern technology. In fact, the whole setting at Hog-Farts seems to be a medieval castle where the children write using quills and flame torches hang on the walls. One would be forgiven for thinking that the need for magic would go if they had electricity. Just because magic is a fact of life why have all the other creatures and beasts of folklore to exist? Quidditch. What a ludicrous, pointless game. Despite the use of broomsticks (see above) Rowling still couldn't think up a better game. I had to pause the film to let the silliness of the game sink in: A whole team (yes a team!) of players goes against another in a sort of flying football/polo sort of game in which balls must go through goals to score points. It seems simple and unsilly enough albeit lacking imagination but the fact that each team possesses a player called a "seeker" who just flies after a golden ball with wings and if one of them catch it, their respective team wins immediately. What's the point of the rest of the game and players? A team could be winning easily and about to win and then the opposing team's seeker catches the golden ball in the last few seconds and wins! How utterly ridiculous! Why not just make the whole game about catching the golden ball and forget the other players and their task?! The plot of this film is incoherent and dull. The first three quarters are an ego trip for the special effects department and just show generic Harry exploring Hog-Farts with his new generic best buddies and gazing in awe at the wonderments inside. The last quarter is explaining some generic evil wizard who wants to come back from prison or something. Needless to say, generic Harry saves the day and is a hero and his "house" wins some cup or something. Big whoop. The old British actors they hired were just to legitimate the whole sordid affair. I am an unrepentant Harry Potter fan.  I adore the books.  I thought I was going to have the holiday season of a lifetime, with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings both coming out within a month of each other.At least there's still Lord of the Rings to salvage the season.Harry Potter was, in fact, very faithful to the words of the book.  The feeling, however, that one gets in reading Rowling was completely gone.  I didn't care about the characters as much, as Columbus didn't feel any need to tell us anything about them beyond the action on the screen; I didn't have any sense of anticipation, except in one scene in the forest (despite the fact that I have that sense each time I read the books); and I wasn't able to get involved in the story because the cuts from scene to scene were so abrupt (and often non-sensical).The effects were worse than the plot.  The troll looked like something by Pixar (Pixar is great, mind you, but it's animation and not realistic). Quidditch looked like a contest to see who could be the blurriest. Harry's much-touted digitally green eyes were only green in a couple of very brief shots.  My own model train set in my living room looks better than the Hogwarts Express.  I could go on, but I don't have the space to list all the problems.My suggestions for the next movie are that the script writer try reading not Rowling's WORDS, but the EMOTIONS she evokes, and that they not rush the production so much that the effects and editing suffer.  I really think that if they hadn't rushed to get this movie done in a year, the effects at least would have been vastly better.The only saving grace in this movie is Williams' score.  It at least lends a little bit of emotion to an otherwise flat movie.My recommendation: buy the soundtrack, and wait for the video.  Don't waste your money in the theatre. I have not and have no intention of reading the books- nothing against them, they just aren't my cup o'tea. I hesitated seeing this film not because of no interest in those books- but because of the director- I have found his films to be trite and cheap and very formula- straight from the Speilberg school of "once I've made my first ba-zillion I can sell out and never have to be creative again". This film has good camera work. It has current state effects. It has a pace akin to running a 24fps film at 1000fps. It's shallow- it asks you to buy into all of it without explanation. There's a fakeness to it leaving me feeling like I had molten Saran-wrap poured over me. I don't care about the characters because they were simply place-holders- no personalities. Harry is so two-dimensional as to make a sheet of paper more intriguing. Perhaps the "genre" just doesn't appeal here. Fans (and most people are either a fan or not- no "in-betweens") ballyhoo this film with that glazed-eye look of cult religionists. Yuck. Children's fantasies reached high tide in the early '80's, but by 1985's "The Goonies," the run was over.  The genre was exhausted.  Except for the technology, nothing is new.  It should not come as a surprise to anyone that director Chris Columbus co-wrote "The Goonies." This explains why so much of "Harry Potter" consists of Ritalin-driven 11-year-olds emitting long howls of . . . . . what? Anguish?  Surprise?  Revulsion?  One is never quite sure.It's just an awful movie.  What need or needs does a movie like this fill in the lives of so many millions?  It is baffling. How on earth did this get up to the lofty heights of an 8.1 rating?I have never read the books, but went to see the film on the back of a good rating here, and many critics saying how good it was.  This film was awful. I'd give it a 5/10 for reasonable sets, costumes, effects and making me laugh (twice). I actually voted it as a 1/10 though to hopefully give some more realism to it's rating.The quidditch game is pathetic. I thought we british invented good games, you know tennis, golf, football, etc. If it's a good game, we invented it. JK Rowling supposedly is british, but judging by this poorly thought through piece of crap she's gotta be american (or worse).The ginger lad gets praised for "the best game of chess ever played at hogwarts" or something, and yet we get to see none of the game other than him making the worst possible first move available to him. An untrained chimpanzee could have guessed a better move. Out of the 20 or so things he could have done how does this master-chess-boy make the worst possible move???The plot is terrible and full of holes, the biggest seeming to be: Why the hell didn't the badguy use his knowledge to get past the dog earlier? He'd known for half the film, but still only just gets there before Harry who only learns at the end how to bypass the dog!I thought no matter what that the film is at least choc full of top quality actors and no matter what it will therefore be at least "ok". How wrong I was... None of the good actors get anything more than tiny bit parts, and mainly even then they act way below standard - but what can be done with this script?All in all, don't see this unless you are a fan of the book, or have some money & time that you absolutely must waste. For a start, the correct title of the book is 'Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S Stone'. Could the retitling of the film have anything to do with the fact that the only audience for this film is actually too dense to have any clue in hell as to what a philosopher is, or for that matter, be able to read it. I think that it's time for a lesson in language from Yodapoo:P-H-I-L-O-S-O-P-H-E-R: Now that wasn't hard was it? Let's find out what it means. - To take an etymological perspective: it comes from the Athical Greek words "phileisthai" - to love and "sophia" - wisdom; now let's see if you can muster enough brain cells to decipher what this could mean (hint: it's a noun) Hmmm... the word 'philosopher' doesn't seem to be as linguistically complicated as some may think. Maybe whoever had the final word on what the film would actually be named woke up one morning and mistook his caffeine pills for 'stupid pills'. Idiots.As for the film itself, the people who made it bought a cauldron, filled it with cinematic turd, brought it to an even boil and carried out the following recipe (for disaster):Child actors as untalented as they are over paid. - An already poor and unbelievable plot. - A distinct lack of any thing at all: the film was not funny, dramatic, scary, adventurous or any other adjective which I can't be bothered to think of right now.In short, this film bites. If you haven't already had the misfortune of watching this cinematic failure, do not- save yourself! This film has less cinematic merit than a blank screen. Once again, avoid this film; disassociate yourself with this film or anything to do with it. All cashing in, no soul.If you want to call your film Star Wars, but are happy to leave the existential matter behind, it creates a product without much of a value.. There is a poor orphan girl who scavenges and has no money, house or friends...But she is one of the best pilots in the galaxy and can pilot a spaceship into space ... even better than its owner and master of many years.Yup said girl can maneuver space ships in deep space no problem.I guess she learnt deep galaxy space travel on the side when she was done for the day scavenging and dumpster diving.Barf at Mary Sue and her bf director Why don't you get your own ideas?How about you for once in your lives come up with an original idea instead of ripping off everything and everyone and trying to make money and money and more money off other people's ideas??Have you heard of film, art, cinema, movies or talent??This film is such a stupid rip off gender switch and why are these actors so bad? Is it because you picked them up at discount alley??? This is well below A You tube video (LOL) that consists of a pathetic and failed attempt at ...... everything (including Mary Sue-ism).Clearly Bad Robot is a very lonely and un-creative place 🤣P.S. What's that STENCH?!? 😖 🤢 It is Jar Jar Abrams In a country that votes for a dotard who imported Chinese steel, stiffed American suppliers and workers, hired illegal aliens in Florida, married a foreigner who worked here illegally, declared bankruptcy three times and of course is making his merchandise in China, but is voted for by "nationalist" voters LMFAO we have a sequel that is a remake that is devoid of any merit,a rt, imagination, hope or acting/directing capability and yet makes a billion dollars.Enough Said. This film is a cover act with no originality or soul.
Star Wars was a classic of film and cinema, This is a creepy and unfunny movie. The Mary Sue has it easy and is wonderfully (cough cough) magical. This is Hollywood at its hammy worst. The joke of a cast barely bothers to make facial expressions. Harrison Ford is game, but has nothing to work with and the robot does what it can. But mostly I spent the movie cringing at the horrible script and Jar Jar's repulsive obeying Kathleen Kennedy's orders. But not as ugly as the rest of the reboot film.Poor Jar Jar Abrams he just remakes and reboots.
They even have a death star here with the very same flaw is the earlier ones.
LMAO Everything coming out of Disney's greedy studio is crap.
They made a joke out of the superhero genre, they made their endless princesses ugly and now they destroyed Star Wars.
Sadness.
Imagine a so-called Star Wars film episode 7 that totally ignores what happened in episode 6. Now imagine no more. It is called The Farce Awakens.
There was an article on the net a year ago about JJ Abrams last wife. At least she must be happy. The pitiful king of Hollywood remakes, reboots and sequels first ripped off and cloned Spielberg, then rebooted Star Trek (and made it a brats movie) and now here rips off George Lucas.How does this guy get laid? Even his wife dumped him.This dumpster fire is not Star Wars. It is a rip off. Let's call it Attack Of The Clone. What a dung heap.Usually I love Star Wars, and even think the prequels were passable. Beelzebub, this movie, though...Bad accents, bad lines, dodgy acting by the entire cast (the Chinese woman was the only thing I liked about the film and she has no reason to be there), lame villains, kindergarten masks, unoriginal teen anger (which may have been the one redeemable aspect), poor plot exposition and at no time did it encourage me to suspend disbelief.At times, when fighting with a light saber, the force inexplicably surges into something and creates a master jedi in a second. Sitting with a friend, we both finished several predictable lines of dialogue prior to the clone parroting it out. Indeed, he is a clone.Oh, and could you stop the jokes, one-liners and misplaced sense of humor. This is not a Disney movie, this is Star Wars... oh wait... never mind.. damn you Lucas.The only good thing about this movie is that it ends. I do not have a hard time placing this film. On one side it's so typically hollywoodish - it's a super-production with Star Wars-related content that would make it probably to many Fan film festivals. It's very conventional in its Sunday morning TV message and the morality tale that it tells is quite conventional, and of course, we know the end of the story, either because we have watched Star Wars or because we have seen enough films from Hollywood or for both reasons. On the other side it's a film by JJ Abrams, so there is a dose of mainstream story-telling and inexplicable plot developments in its characters. The special effects are 100% created for the movie and uninspired.So it's the story of Episode IV without any twists.What makes it worse are elements of fan fiction in the story telling, distracted (but not awful) acting from Leia, Rey and others and the computer-generated special effects which succeed to create a level of thrill to a story. Did we need this story and episode? At this level of amateurishness the answer is no. The treasury department awakens.After the painful sell out by George Lucas to the evil Disney empire we get this modern day cliche-laden standard issue gender switch reboot that will inspire a whole number of accounting departments to demand even more remakes and gender switch films with simplistic story lines. It's a sad movie where Star Wars becomes a simplistic and childish film where everything happens too easily for the ugly Mary Sue. Don't listen to the positive reviews by Disney contractors in India and The Philippines it's a sad attempt at bilking cash from morons.That is all. 0/10
Now THIS is RUBBISH!
This movie is rubbish, childish, and well crafted to make money only.
The film is incredibly stupid with joke after lame joke, Mary Sue, rip off and a horribly lazy plot.This movie will make you hate Disney, and remind you how terrible JJ Abrams is. If you actually like Star Wars you will demand Disney go the way of the VHS.It is safe to say that J.J Abrams has fulfilled his mission in bringing back Star Wars to its former glory! Cannot wait for Episode 9!Rating: 10 out of 10 But yeah, nothing to see here except mindless, tasteless troll garbage from troll garbase master Jar Jar AbramsMove along and go watch actual amazing Star Wars films, like every single one before 2015! I am sick of Disney gender switch propaganda and this film is just that plus JJ Abrams doing his usual commercial offal. I hope that one day someone will make a movie about JJ Abrams destroying the world of film and producing 'return on investment.' I was looking at a list of gender switches then I came across this video The farce awakens is the worst movie all of time! it's really true that many are saying the farce awakens is the worst movie of all time out of all the horrible movies. I didn't watch the whole remake as it was so terrible because I felt ill. Overall this was a boring fecal film. Do not watch this video. I think only interesting part was this: one of them was a chick that cannot die so she was safe in her knowledge of another pay check from episode 8. However the other girl, er I mean cosplayer, looks as much a loser as his love interest. At the end it turns out he is worse than his only friend (in acting). So are we surprised? Yes, that this film was not straight to video. Star Wars movies used to be great. Remember that? Remember how they inspired a generation of loyal fans? Remember how they virtually saved cinema from terminal audience decline in the 70s? So scoot forward 40 years, and see the empty soulless rubbish lapped up by brainwashed Pavlovian audiences and critics. How much did Disney pay the critics for all those gushing reviews? Either that or the art of film criticism has been lost.Lucas may be $4 billion richer but I bet he wishes he hadn't sold the rights. Star Wars will now be forced down your throat, hyped beyond hype, new toys every month. The dollars will keep rolling in.This movie is just a total rip off of the original trilogy; nothing original in it all. It sucks the joy out of this franchise. It revels in the stupid. A Death Star that can't go anywhere, A Death Star whose Death Ray is faster than light (how else can it reach those systems in seconds?) Luke Skywalker. Hero for millions all over the world. Here he has run away. People who can become master Jedi without training. Poe's amazing reusable jacket - which he should still be wearing when Fin picks it up. A hundred other mistakes and holes. Yep. Thanks Abrahams.Han Solo. One of the most beloved cinema icons of all. Written out because a bored actor wants another Indiana Jones Movie. Princess Leia. Or what passes for Princess Leia. Just sad. All the original cast are basically guest stars in their own franchise, so we can have a younger generation take over and keep milking the cash for another 40 years.Ah, yes, JJ. himself. Started out as a Spielberg hack, became a Roddenberry hack, now a Lucas hack. Yep, a third-rate hack all round. This guy has ruined more franchises then anyone I can think of.This is the future of modern cinema. And you're welcome to it. Remember when mainstream movies used to be good? Completely recycled story, this movie is really a remake of episode 4. Rey she's technology wizard, learns to fly the millennium falcon in 5 minutes with no prior flight experience unlike Luke who was already trained as a pilot, she also learns to use the force with no prior force experience after just being told about it uses mind tricks which took Luke several years to learn to do. Not only that she also kicks the ever- living crap out of Ren with no prior jedi training at all compared to Ren that has experience of both the light and the dark side of the force.Leia Should have gotten way more screen time!Ren he should be renamed Darth Emo.It's a decent movie nice effect but it completely butchers the star wars lore. What really sells this movie is the star wars name. I would like to start this review but saying that I have seen all the movies and have read almost every expanded universe book that has been written, something that I highly doubt J.J. Abrams has done. There weren't many things done right with this movie except that the graphics looked good and there was not an annoying Jar Jar Binks-like character. The major issues that I see are:1) The movie is essentially a remake of the original Star Wars. The new rebellion (aka the Resistance). A new empire (aka the First Order). A new Luke Skywalker (aka Rey). New Death Star (aka much bigger death star). I don't even know if they can come back from this...2) The expanded universe books are so good and they decided to completely trash everything that has been written about Star Wars and start over. I think this is a big mistake.3) The casting seemed motivated from a diversity/politically correct perspective. I am all for diversity, but they went way overboard.4) The strong female main character, Rey, is from a backwater planet with virtually nothing positive to say about it. However, she is stronger, faster, and smarter than everyone around her including Han Solo and the trained warrior, Finn (more comments about him below). She knows how to fix and fly a starship. She can use a light saber and beat a trained dark-side force user in one-on-one combat. This trained force user is incredibly powerful as shown by his ability to stop a blaster bolt in mid-fire, something that would be incredibly difficult for only but the strongest force users. Also, she showed Han Solo how to fix his ship that he has been using for 50 years.5) Finn is a storm trooper, taken from his parents at birth and trained as a fighter and warrior. Yet, he acts scared throughout the movie. He doesn't know how to fight, fly a ship, or anything else a trained warrior should be able to do. Instead, Rey, who grew up on a backwater planet is the fighter and not afraid of anything. Rey, who was never trained to do anything really except survive on a backwater desert planet.I am extremely disappointed and cannot imagine that George Lucas approved of this. I have lost a LOT of respect for J. J. Abrams and think that he might have irretrievably ruined the story line. The Force Goes to sleep in this Disney/Abrams reboot marketing product.No talent, imagination nor any creativity. First, the script is a boring remake combining story plots/structure from IV,V,VI.I can't believe they dared to give us another Death Star and to hide data in a robot on the run on a sand planet. Pathetic.Abrams is definitely a BAD ROBOT, who robotically copycat without any talent a Master creation. He made of an epic tale a TV reboot for stupid teens.Bad casting, bad acting.Not a single spectacular,mind blowing scene.You go to see this for Han, Leia (Luke?) and their great actors.Star Wars VII is a fraud, a bad, shameless enterprise, with a very stupid, emotionless script.Definitely, don't touch other artist's creation if you're only after the check and have no talent.The great thing about VII, it make you miss the genius of visionary George Lucas. Even his "fans hated" prequel look now like masterpieces of visual and entertaining magic. You should only watch this if you don't care or want to see the 'old gang' back together and as you would imagine them to be 30 years on.Going in to this I had a relatively short list of what I hoped the movie makers wouldn't do. The main one being break the team up...and what do you read in the opening crawl...they've broken the team up. Why? Because of lazy writing and because they wanted us all to love the new and shiny characters they've foisted on us. so they made the old characters act like complete and total losers, like others have said Han goes back to smuggling and ripping people off, he's left his wife, Leia's back to being cranky and she's got no relationships left except for the droids and seriously that red arm is just dumb.We've got another Skywalker as the bad guy, Han and Leia broke up and Luke's gone off on some yoga retreat. And don't get me started on the supposed bad guy...what a joke. Equipment is expensive but apparently the 'first order' (whatever the F that is) don't care that he routinely smashes all their expensive equipment.The Force is treated with no respect at all. On one hand it doesn't seem to work ie Leia can't find Luke and Kylo can't sense his father three metres away, but then it works all the time for our new 'heroes' but I'm sure Disney will dismantle them too when they want to sell more useless bits of plastic.It's like Disney figured everyone complained about too much 'story' in the prequels and to make it easy on people (cos they figure we're all stupid) they'd get rid of the history totally. The easiest way to bring in a new baddie is to make him a Skywalker, make him responsible for the downfall of the old heroes and then get him to kill one. Star Wars was originally about redemption but I don't really see what message it sends that someone can murder their father in cold blood to then be redeemed (assuming that's the direction they go in).This movie will be forgotten very quickly and Star Wars is just a new Transformers/Avengers type franchise. Nothing special anymore. Not a moral tale, seriously how inappropriate was Han's death for a movie for kids? It will get recast and remade over and over. No one will love these new characters as much as the old ones.Disney has wasted a golden opportunity. I don't consider this movie Canon. Bring back George This is my first review of a movie and I just had to put it out there. Guidelines on this site require that I put 10 lines of text in this review but to be honest I am not really sure this movie deserves that much. I do not know how critics came up with such high marks for this movie but scenario and characters felt like something that has no connection with the ideas established in the Star Wars universe from original trilogy. As for the content of the movie, I think that Han Solo actually killed himself in the end while thinking: "Thank God this is over!". If he didn't, who knows what would they make him to in the next movie. Sell lollipops perhaps?At least my $12 popcorn bag was good until it lasted.That is all I have to say. It was a train wreck. Do you people out there really want to see the same plot over and over? The Jedi are MIA. The Galaxy is ruled by an evil empire. They have a huge space station that can destroy planets. Droid with important info gets lost and is found by the heroes. Space station is attacked and destroyed by the rebels. Sound familiar? The dialog was boring and predictable and I didn't care about the characters. If this movie had been made in 1977 instead of the first movie it would have been a total dud. The only surprise was when they killed off Han Solo, the one character I liked. Star Wars is dead, PLEASE let it rest in peace! I will never go to another movie with J.J. Abrams name on it. When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer, I was pretty excited. I wasn't a major Transformers fan, but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However, I hated the re-designed Transformers, thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego's Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor, so I decided to skip this one.However, I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. "The greatest film of all time!" people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren't the robots I grew up with, this was a "new" version, and I'd at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I'd even go see this even though I don't like Michael Bay films.How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and self-indulgent piece of crap. I understand that I'll get rated down for my review, but I'm prepared to accept that. Sadly, my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got, causing me to gush over this film like other people.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another, and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line, but the action was good, showed the consequences of war, and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos, even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you've seen before.Bumblebee sends up an "Autobat Symbol" to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There's a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 (and a few scenes later, uses the exact drumbeat from the "Terminator Theme"). The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and "shaky cam" style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were "Saving Private Ryan" caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene, the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically, that it makes the tragedies found in "Schindler's List" seem modest.The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy, which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble, and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from "Trilogy of Terror". During the final battle, I was having problems telling who was who, and when the robots collided, it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases, ripped straight from a commercial. Then again, there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.The slow set-up to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like "The Hulk". I pay for a movie about transforming robots, that's what I want to see.Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam, a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this "All-Spark" out of the desert and into a heavily-populated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful, sounded like it was written for teenagers, by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn't seem to kill a Decepticon, but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee, but they can't repair Jazz? What was the difference? The government/military/robot/anyone dialogue was totally unrealistic, with officials willing to "bet their ridiculously high government paychecks" on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns, clichés, or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn't touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry, where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and fun-loving with a sense of style, while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity, and I felt insulted. Not because of the language, but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren't much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously, Bay's madness knew better than to totally ruin this character, as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene, where Prime's personality suddenly shifts, breaks character, and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene, he shifts back into a "leader" personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), who brought a credible "gee whiz" performance to the film, and yet I felt sorry for him using such ham-fisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for "blockbuster" films, as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards, "sit back, not think and enjoy" with these types of films, but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart, personality or no focus on the main characters? As a stand-alone film, this is a really bad movie. As a Transformers-licensed film, it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to high-school level online fanfic. This deafeningly loud, obnoxious, usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the all-time greatest summer flicks ever. However, despite the advancements in today's special effects, it being inspired from the highly popular 1980's Hasbro toys and cartoon, with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer, Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a "steaming pile." I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn't work for me.The story was about a teenager name Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who purchases a car that happens to be a robot in disguise from another world. Sam is then caught in the middle of an ancient battle between two groups of these alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Both are seeking a mysterious cube known as the "Allspark" that contains their "life source." This central plot intertwines with the story of a special ops team being attacked by one of the Decepticons in the beginning, the pentagon enlisting teams of computer hackers to decode a signal they detected that ultimately came from the Decepticons and a hokey love story between Sam and Mikaela, the gorgeous bombshell in his class.As intriguing as all of this may sound, besides the many battle scenes, car chases, attempts on Sam's life and Decepticon attacks, nothing happens to move the story along. Whatever layers of stories that were suppose to be happening beneath the unimpressive action sequences were uneventful and slow. So, all you're left with is the action, which by the end was boring and tedious to watch.The characters were flat and moronic. The humans were one-note, soulless caricatures. They were also more than capable of damaging the robots, which took away from the extraordinary antagonism the original cartoon presented for our human heroes. The humans were helpless against the Decepticons and this made the Autobots necessary. In this absurd film, the humans didn't really need the Autobots to take out the Decepticons.And whatever happened to characters like Jorge "Fig" Figueroa and Maggie? They sort or left this film halfway to the end to join the film playing in the theater next door.Also, part of the cartoon's success was the personalities of the Transformers. They were emotional beings that were capable of treacherous, loyal, courageous, cowardice, morose and optimistic behavior. They weren't just giant piles of junk destroying an American metropolis. Whatever happened to the ongoing struggle for power over the Decepticons between Starscream and Megatron? This would've added some real complexity to this paper-thin story. Instead, Bay and the writers settled for hinting at it with a laughable one-liner from Megatron that rang falser than the action. Wasn't Bumblebee the kindest, frailest of them all? He was essential for his undying compassion for the humans in the cartoons. Not in this film, where he obviously fought in many battles and, when annoyed, can urinate on a human being at any given time. Now going from the true character to the characterizations of the robots, the looks of the original were more engaging and attractive to the eye. In this film, they looked like metal scraps of junk.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the Black-American soul, screaming, "What up, b****es?" Ironically, he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now, a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy, unimaginative, sloppy, hack writing and directing. In the end, I couldn't care less about any of the characters, human or Transformer.The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However, when the characters weren't trying to be funny in this film, the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous, with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in, like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons (John Turturro) was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV, revealing Mikaelas' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point, I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides, the whole introducing-yourself-thing from the Transformers, especially the Decepticons, was extra cheddar cheesy to me: "I am Megatron!" Yeah, and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could've gotten the collective "heave-hove" from this film as well.The special effects were cool but could've been better. Most of the time, the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing, unorthodox way they transformed, not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal, revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director, I wouldn't be satisfied with the end result.The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a U-Turn, these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay, maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.In my opinion, Bay, Spielberg and the writers massacred what could've been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst, overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood. (This comment was deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report filed by another user, so I'm guessing it was pretty abusive; maybe it spoiled some aspect of "the plot," if you can call it that, for some poor soul)I think it was about four or five words into the opening narration when we burst into laughter. "Before time began..." Ouch. When a film can't go 5 seconds without a cliché, it doesn't deserve to be watched, at least not with a straight face.Michael Bay's Transformers is hilariously awful, a sub-Ed Wood affair all the way through, a camp classic in the making. If Bay is the new Edward D. Wood, Jr. then Transformers may be the new Plan 9 from Outer Space. Let me count the ways: 1. Incoherent narration/ incoherent plot? Check.2. Laughably bad dialogue? Check.3. Pompous aliens with inexplicable plan to conquer Earth? Check.4. Day turns to night in an instant? Check.5. Copious use of military stock footage? Check.6. Epic numbers of continuity errors? Check.7. Dramatic confrontations solved via fistfights? Check.8. Dramatic scenes that fly straight out of left field? Check. ("I'm so glad I got in the car with you.") 9. Formerly respectable older star sinks to a new low? Check. (Poor, poor Jon Voight) 10. Incredible overacting that is obviously encouraged by the director? Check.11.Character who cannot speak for no apparent reason? Check.12. Rampant stereotyping (not just the racial ones but stuff like cops acting dumb, doing a lot of shouting, and eating doughnuts, and military officials being all secretive one minute and spilling said secrets the next)? Check.13. Characters with a lot of face time who end up playing no important role in the "story?" Check. (What useful purpose did Duhamel and the troops in Qatar serve after the first ten minutes?) 14. Heavy handed social/political commentary/references? Check. (eBay, eBay, eBay;imagine how much trouble could have been avoided if they'd just BOUGHT THE DAMN GLASSES OFF OF EBAY!) 15. A flying saucer catches on fire then crashes? Check.16. Sudden flashes of light appear from nowhere and knock characters over? Check.17. The action in some shots is hopelessly muddled? Check.18. A character's hilarious death scene is matched only by his hilarious eulogy? Check.19. The action halts suddenly so that someone can explain the back-story? Check.20. Random bursts of laughter fill theater during screening? Check.21. Gaps in dialogue perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque commentary? Check.22. Inevitable cult following? Check.Only these three things are missing, keeping it from true Ed Wood greatness: 1. No giant octopus. (Though Scorponok comes pretty close.)2. No transvestites. (It has the prefix "trans-" in the title, though.)3. No ludicrously campy speech made by the main villain. (Just " I AM MEGATRON!!!", which is plenty campy but not much of a speech.) Maybe these'll be in the director's cut.Except, of course, Ed Wood's movies had heart; even at their worst they feel like more than exercises in feature-length product placement. Bay doesn't have anything even remotely resembling a heart in his chest - that's why he's not even in Wood's league as a bad director, no matter how many laughs his terrible films get. And at least Wood's films didn't cost $150 million to make.I'm a Transformers fan from way back. I've got an Optimus Prime and a Megatron atop one of my bookshelves. I have ancient videotapes of the fondly remembered cartoon series and a copy of the 20th anniversary movie DVD. I had worried that this film would damage my childhood memories beyond repair, like Star Wars Episode I did. But the film is just TOO bad and TOO stupid to have any real effect on me. The old animated movie, bad as it is, mops the floor with this one. If anything, it is a more mature(!) and entertaining work. The music in the old movie is terrible, but it fits. The music here is just terrible.There are good points, but none anywhere near enough. John Turturro is the only actor who escapes this mess unscathed - his great over-the-top performance suggests that he actually understands how Z-grade the script he was given was. He's a lot of fun to watch, even as he's quickly reduced to a non-entity by the plot mechanics. Turturro is a great actor and this part only serves to elevate his status in my eyes. I hope he got a serious paycheck.I can't stand CGI as a rule, but the special effects here are moderately convincing, at least in those rare moments when the camera isn't performing idiotic cartwheels to obscure them. I honestly like the models for the new TFs (the Autobots, anyway - I can barely tell the Decepticons apart), but the fact that they have little personality isn't so endearing.Maybe the sequel will be up to the lofty standards of Ed Wood's Night of the Ghouls. But I doubt it. I honestly don't know where to start with this movie. I will say however, that - like many other people - this is the film I've been waiting 20 years to see.I suppose it's sensible to start with what should be the foundation stone of any cinematic experience - the script. It's cheesy, cliché-ridden, and poorly-structured. Characterisation (especially of the Autobots/Decepticons) is non-existent. Optimus Prime uttering the words "My bad" must go down in history as one of the worst moments in movie history. Actually scratch that - the "lubricating" scene is definitely worse. The writing of human characters is lazy at best, sticking with stereotypes such as the beautiful code-breaker, fat computer whizz, bumbling government agent etc etc. The performances (Shia aside) are instantly forgettable, but a great deal of that comes down to the script and direction. Megan Fox may be a great actress for all I know, but she may as well be a stripper for the purposes of this movie.The effects are incredible (although not helped by Bay's erratic editing style), but when you've no reason to care about them it results in an empty experience. Effects DON'T MAKE A MOVIE.With Spielberg as part of this project I allowed myself a little optimism, but it's patently clear that Bay and Co. had no understanding or respect for the Transformers franchise. GIANT "FLIPPING" ROBOTS BLOWING "STUFF" UP this may be, but it is most certainly not Transformers. This was one crappy movie and a pain to watch. Just hearing Optimus Prime utter "Oops my bad", made me want to bolt for the door. Anyway, here is just a brief summary of all the good and bad this movie has to offer.The Good:The transformations- I'm surprised at how well they made the transformations work. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron don't look half as bad as I thought they would. It's nice to see the parts warp and change instead of watching these big blocky characters that were in the cartoon.The Bad:On my, where do I start...The jokes were awful. For some reason they decided to make this movie as a crossover between American Pie and Transformers. Bumblee "lubricating" the man and Sam masturbating, just wasn't funny. The only people who were laughing in the audience were little kids.The humans stole the show. I thought Transformers was supposed to be about the Transformers themselves, who each had unique personalities with a little human action thrown in the background. Instead the tables are reversed, where we are FORCED to spend lengthy amounts of time with characters the audience truly doesn't give a rat's ass about. Who cares about Sam Whitwickey? Or that smart programming chick? Or that fat donut eater? Who honestly gives? This is a Transformers movie folks, not a love story with some dumb robots thrown in for kicks. Oh and Sam himself, was super, duper irritating and annoying.The choreography was terrible. Some fight scenes were cool enough but the shaky camera movements and extreme closeups made it difficult to tell what was going on. The fight between Megatron and Optimus proved to be extremely disappointing, as we are only given a few shots of Optimus punching and tripping Megatron, while the army tries to destroy Blackout. -They completely destroyed the Transformers back story. Those even remotely interested in the Transformers will know that they came from Cybertron and that their ship crashed on Earth only to be revived centuries later. But here Cybertron is destroyed to pieces with no chance of it ever being revived. Well, I guess the Transformers are screwed folks ... but they already were when Michael Bay decided to direct.In short, if you were expecting to see a movie about the Transformers, you were sadly mistaken. Be prepared to spend hours focusing on Sam and his loser girlfriend instead. Also, why the hell did it take an hour and a half for Optimus Prime to show up in the first place- that to me, is a disgrace. Tripe. Filth. Mud. Worthless. Blunt. Stupid. These are six words that aptly describe the idea behind Michael Bay's latest smash-fest "TRANSFORMERS." As one of those "poor saps" (as I was called while waiting in the theater) who had never seen the TV show as a child, I went into the movie expecting nothing, especially considering that Michael Bay is one of the least artistic, most pandering directors of the present. But once the movie started, it was all right. Shia LeBeouf was charming, as was the quirky teen-humor that pervaded the first 45 minutes. In fact, the Transformers were pretty bad-ass....Until minute 46, when they began to talk. Not only was their behavior evocative of stoners and idiots, they lumbered around his backyard, and, later in the movie, peed on a federal agent. There was even one transformer (I forget the name, and I am all the better for it) that talked like he was from the "projects." The plotting was puerile and idiotic. There was even a subplot where Shia LeBeouf's love interest was discovered to have a criminal record, but that subplot was handily absolved five minutes later when Shia LeBeouf cuts a deal with the government. SO STUPID AND POINTLESS! Not to mention, the movie abounded with Michael Bay's never-ending car chases and slow-motion hoohah. Very very bad scripting like "I'm not leaving without Bumblebee!" and the leader of the good Transformers saying "Oops, my bad" made for a horrible experience.The bulk of the movie was terrible. The acting, aside from noticeably realistic screams from Shia and others, was stilted and just perfect for the sort of film that doesn't even hide that it relies wholly on special-effects and the toy franchise itself, the kind of things that Michael Bay loves to beat over movie-goers' heads like a blunt object. I saw the advance screening a few days ago and in a nutshell, two whole years of anticipation were stripped away by a flash of severe disappointment within the first 45 mins of this film. I'm a hard-core G1 fan and can't tell you how blasphemous this film is to those of us who who followed the original series from Cybertronian history to character profiles and traits.The script itself is utter garbage and reminiscent of a Disney film with ultra-lame jokes and childish references. The mere reference to teenage masturbation in one scene is just completely uncalled for and unnecessary in this film. Too much focus was placed on the human characters than the Transformers themselves who are the stars of the show. It's sad that the original film in '86 was a lot darker than this slop that Dreamworks has tastelessly thrown together and expected us to swallow. There's absolutely no character development regarding either clan of robots. The only thing keeping my attention was Peter Cullen's voice as 'Prime...that's the ONLY justice Dreamworks has afforded this film. I understand they needed new body styles to fit today's society...not a problem...but they should still have the same basic look in robot mode and the same voices!! Starscream was everyone's favourite Decepticon...he looked awesome and his trademark voice made the character. He's now absolutely hideous, completely beyond recognition and his voice is just as low and bland as the rest of the characters.Way too much comedy in this film...Transformers don't tip-toe around people's front lawns in the middle of the night trying not to be seen by human parents...that's lame. Transformers is an epic, intergalactic war over ENERGON, not this "allspark" that Dreamworks fabricated. It's a dark battle, like Lord of the Rings but with Cybertronians! My last argument has to be the score/soundtrack. Talk about minimalist...Steve Jablonsky did NOTHING for this film. Was Danny Elfman not available?! All my fellow fans out there need to know that the Transformers theme song does NOT even appear in the film, ANYWHERE by ANY means. Not even a melodic reference to it in the orchestral score which I find completely absurd. The band Mute Math did the theme for the soundtrack allegedly though it never actually plays in the film, not even over the end credits!! From start to finish this was absolute mockery of all traits that made the original series and film so great...it's nothing now. I'm forced to pretend this new film doesn't even exist because it's defiled the Transformer name so bad...a complete injustice to my expectations as a true fan. If they have the nerve to make sequels to this slop I refuse to watch. What a huge let down! I'm a transformer fan that was hoping to see a cool SCI-FI about the Transformers, but instead I got a dumb slap stick comedy that makes fun of them. This movie has a randomly generated plot that only matches the worst type of teen comedy. I can't even say it was better then Epic Movie. There was even an American Pie rip off moment where the main human characters parents think he locked the door to masturbate. They even go to the levels as to have a transformer pee on someone. Thinking about this movie gives me a headache and based on the ratings and reviews so far I am extremely concerned about where society is going as whole. You will only like this movie if you are a young teen that does not know any better or you are a babbling(typically obnoxious in theaters)idiot. The only positive thing I can say is that the transformers where done in very good detail, which seems to only make me starve for the movie I had hoped to see.Very very very very sad. Seriously, why do we still see Michael Bay movies? We, as a people, need to unite against him. And how in God's name is this movie in the top 250 right now? This movie is lucky that I just saw Spiderman 3, otherwise this would be the worst movie of all time. Michael Bay just does the same thing in every movie: way too many helicopters, pilots running to their planes, and the flare overhead to alert the planes (why didn't he just use stock footage of Nicholas Cage from The Rock?)And John Turturro, why? You are a great actor, why reduce yourself to this trash? Please tell me you got paid over 10 million for this. Words cannot describe how bad the script of this movie is. I was dying laughing at Optimus Prime's emotional "Were we so different" speech. And the scene at Sam's house that goes on for about 16 hours with the American Pie rip-off? The Transformers are treated like little kids in that scene who say things like "My bad" and "Oops". Are you kidding me? These are The Transformers, not the Ninja Turtles. The thing I don't get is how people liked this movie. Shia wasn't bad and the girl was hot (while doing her best Jennifer Connelly in Blood Diamond impression), but the rest of the characters were miserable. Am I the only one who thinks that Anthony Anderson's line in Entourage ("You need any color in that movie?") is really the only way he gets any acting jobs? Needless to say, I hated this movie and simply laughed at it with my friends the whole time. But I contributed to Michael Bay making more movies, and for that I am sorry It worries me that anyone could actually fall for **** like this in this day and age...Michael Bay's latest crime against the cinema is by far his most by-the-numbers venture yet with so little creativity that it should be considered punishable. Big explosions, high-priced special effects meant to dazzle, generic comedy, and female cast members meant to dazzle are just about all this movie has to offer, and it all culminates in a big battle in downtown Los Angeles that by nature and set-up is almost as implausible as even the inclination that a guy with Shia LeBouf's face could score a pity date with a girl that looks like Megan Fox without fame or fortune to help. Yet as a summer movie the audience is not simply sold this idea but expected to accept it in a "neat" marketable package complete with overwhelming amounts of product placement. As a result a vicious cycle is born. Visuals reign over every aspect of this film as it does in many of its kind which leaves little room for anything else that is supposed to make up a movie, and too often the story is the first victim and audiences buy into it like a toddler distracted by a shiny set of keys. The robot effects are nothing short of impressive, but with the price tag on this production they should be at the least. However movies are not simply pretty moving pictures. The story does matter, and that is why blockbusters are considered by many to be a joke.Transformers is really no different from the blockbusters that have become easy cannon fodder either. Plot-holes and inconsistencies are usually considered a hindrance, but in a movie like Transformers the audience is supposed to accept the idea that taking the catalyst for the movie's battles into town to in affect endanger countless lives is a good plan. Not only that, but taking it by helicopter is safe or sensible when two of the most violent pursuers can easily fly faster and would be willing to shoot the helicopter down. All of the characters are shallow and sometimes superfluous. Look no further than Anthony Anderson's character for an example of a role that takes up time unnecessarily and is ultimately meaningless. In this case even a lead character in Optimus Prime is not fully developed. Much of what we know about him depends solely on preexisting knowledge of the franchise. For anyone else his nobility is simply to be taken at face value without much of a basis. When you see him bypass a crashing helicopter for the "allspark" (*cough*MacGuffin*cough*) it really makes all of the talk about protecting humans feel a little pretentious. Then again the very design of the robots in this movie are contradictory.If the Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be alien robots, their designs don't reflect that at all. The fact that Bumblebee has an engine is really absurd. He's not a car, he just needs to look like one to an outsider. Optimus Prime's face looks like it's constructed of truck parts when if he is meant to be a robot first and truck second he should just have a face...period. The same can be said for all of the robots (look at Blackout's hand in the close-up for example). Too much of their look is steeped in the technology of Earth when that really doesn't make any sense considering their origins. But that's only a part of the problem here. The real problem lies in the shitty cinematography and even lousier action. Fights in this movie look like scrap-metal tumbleweeds. A lot of what goes on is indecipherable nonsense that lasts all of seconds on-screen WHEN it actually is on-screen. Even the climatic final battle is rather anti-climatic.In the end what you're left with is a ****-stain of formula right down to the awful Goo-Goo Dolls song that accompanies the ultra-implausible half-ass teen romantic-"comedy" that most of this movie centers around augmented by pro-militarism in the most idiotic and insipid way. Plenty of detail went into the SFX of the movie, but even that was misdirected. The story didn't receive half as much attention, and it wouldn't have taken 1/8 of the work and that is one of the key flaws. If effects were all that mattered then there really would be no such thing as a good or bad movie (and that goes double for the BS inclination toward "judging a movie for what it is"). Narrative is more important than the "whizz-bang" and "aint-that-cool" of special effects. One need look no further than a lower-tech classic of the genre like Aliens, or Terminator 2 to see my point. Comedy also shouldn't be so painfully transparent as that defeats the purpose of the joke. If you don't see that you probably like this movie. If that's the case then you should know that you're ****ing up the genre for the rest of us... I loved the cartoon series as a kid and, after seeing the commercials, thought it would be freaking awesome. Instead, I wound up stuck in a movie with a ridiculous plot, too many irrelevant characters, and too much sex humor for a movie that is supposed to be about giant robots wailing on each other (I am in my twenties and male, so I can hardly be considered a prude. The fact that even I cringed at the mother making masturbation jokes means that there is such a thing as a limit for that sort of humor). Most of the Transformers do not even show up until the movie is halfway over. The subplot of the signal detection team (who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the network-a no-brainer) could be cut without losing anything of note (except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's on-screen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool). And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent, and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar, but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie. If you copy and pasted scenes from Independence Day, Matrix Revolutions, a bunch of US air force commercials and Bad Santa all together on your computer, you would wind up with basically the same mess. 10 reasons but I could write 1001:1-) Optimus Prime, Megatron (what was with that voice?), Soundwave, Starscream, were they supposed to be the ones wee saw in the cartoons? 2-) Where was UltraMagnus, HotRod and others...? 3-)Humans are suppose to be helpless against Decepticons and Autobots!!! 4-) Transformers are supposed to be about transformers! 5-) Confusing action scenes! Who's shooting who? 6-) High school students are the best sound analyst the US government is capable to get! hahaha! ;) 7-) A hand full of hole plots! 8-) Final battle is planned to be taking in the city by US military forces! OK! That's credible ;) 9-) Megatron killed by Sam! What the f*** 10-) I took my girlfriend to see this movie, big mistake! ;) I always liked Transformers, and this movie was one of my must-see-this-year, I really wanted to see this one so, but now Im now I just want to forget it.The movie is full of incomplete scenes and things that don't have anything to do with the rest of the movie at all. And all the obvious product placement scenes made it look like long commercial some times.The camera angel was just awful and painful to see, unnecessary zooms and when somebody is running it shakes like a earthquake and you can't see the person is running in a forest or a city.The animation scenes was quite okay, but when people was running throughout the Transformers, I became frustrated, but when they ran throughout the broken lamp post I almost ran out.I had hoped for a more serious movie but, when I laugh it wasn't for the jokes but for how bad the movie was.So to end this, I think you should watch the previews and trailers instead they were much better and cheaper. Enjoy! I went into this movie expecting mindless action and cool looking robots, and was very disappointed. Forget that it had almost no story, and the story it did have was lame. Forget that it was basically a two-hour commercial for the army. The bottom line is that this was the worst looking 150 million dollar movie I have ever seen. It looked like a bunch of actors in front of a blue screen pretending to interact with extremely cartoonish-looking robots.And what was that garbage about how most of the transformers almost never spoke? It was like they couldn't be bothered to write dialogue, so they made the robots mostly mute, and tried to fill time with lame sub-plots like the army guy trying to get home to see his daughter. Seriously, any jerk can try to pull you in with cheap sentimentality, but it is pretty obvious that Michael Bay couldn't make a movie with anything resembling real emotion or dialogue if his life depended on it. With this movie, Bay has solidified his position as the worst director of our generation. I would rather watch two hours of security camera footage of a garbage dump that watch this movie again. This movie really makes you wonder about lots of things:1. Does it have a screenplay or is the plot made up along the way? (Like the last seasons of X-Files :) ) 2. If it does have a screenplay why was it written the way it was? A. The screenplay writers where stupid. B. The public that the screenplay was intended for is stupid. C. The screenplay was made to make the public stupid (which goes under government conspiracy theories :) ). 3. Do movie directors have sex in periods between two films? 4. Are some of the IMDb comments written by the movie promoters? 5. What is colder outer space or North Pole? (check the Wikipedia for that one :))And some trivial questions like:6. Why do small robots act like gremlins? (from the movie gremlins that is) 7. How can a robot from another planet know when you plan to buy a used car? 8. Do used cars come with some kind of papers (previous owners, registration plates, etc)? 9. What can a robot gain by hooking up two teenagers? 10. Can a teenager out run a robot that can change himself into a car? 11. Can a teenager defeat a robot in hand to hand combat if the robot previously killed loads of air force 1 security team members? 12. If you where frozen on North Pole years before 1897 (there was no radio or TV stations back then and certainly there was no Internet) how is it possible that you can speak fluent English upon your unfreezing? 13. After being frozen for decades would your first word be: "I am Megatron."? 14. Would you arrange a massive fight in an overpopulated area or in a desert? 15. How is it that an entire army base is destroyed by just one robot but the same robot is killed by one man?There are loads of questions more but my mind is too buffled by the recent movie experience. But the biggest question is:16. How many times is the computer animation budget larger than the screenplay budget?A. 2 times? B. 100 times? C. 1.000.000 times? D. 0 times (cos you can't divide a number by 0)? Ah, so clever they are at throwing all the best bits of the film into one trailer.I was close to giving it a 2 . .but no, I'm sorry, they really don't deserve it :) For the first ten to twenty minutes of this film I had relatively good vibes. But then something happened, and quite rightly as another user has stated, it starts a down hill spiral.It's quite obvious why this one was released for independence day. It has all the elements. .ludicrous plot, abominable script, lots of things blowing up with sparks and fireworks. Those, and the usual actors thrown in to do nothing more than show a comedic face while performing some antic in the film purely to raise the laughter bar.I know that this was an adaptation, I know that it was not meant to be taken seriously; unfortunately the film makers are asking me to deal with two different kinds of movie here. The first, a semi serious military campaign going badly wrong with Robot invasion. The second, little Johnny and potential love interest counterpart have to save the world from evil robot dominance; they do this after the robots suss out who they are courtesy of ebay and with a succession of ridiculous and badly staged situational hazards.I'm sorry, but no amount of special effects or large robots rolling around in the air and into each other can save something that was conceived on Stifflers homework paper.I lost respect for this film the moment it turned into something that pubescent teens would find wildly entertaining."Bros not Ho's man!" Titters the youth three rows down the isle in the auditorium.The product placement was ingenious I have to say, the pepto(a)bysmol on the table after the black guy has finished his plate of ten to fifteen donuts, I'm so glad they don't stereo type.I didn't intend to rip this film apart for all it's cute moments of Robotic wisdom, but well, I guess like Modern day Hollywood, I just got carried away. A scurvy turkey, with exhausting visuals, poor characterization (no need to ask why Megan Fox was cast for this movie; J. Voight et J Turturro, almost not recognizable, leave no imprint on this film, obviously came to collect, nothing more)... As usual with Michael Bay : heat, big machines (copters or planes, depending on film period), guns, brainless teenagers, big cars, dazzling visuals: summer blockbuster all right....but hey, what did I expect? This is a Michael Bay movie. This sums it up. No need to have a script (map engraved on glasses, uh?) when the point is to relaunch a toy line, make some product placement and re-use an existing idea (bad vs evil... black vs white... which means here : Autobots vs Decepticons) "The Worst Film Ever Made" was a previous title I held for another Michael Bay film Armageddon. I'm not a fan of his movies but I was however willing to give this movie a chance as it looked like fun. I was never a fan of the original cartoon as I was too old at the time but I did see and enjoy the carton Movie in 1996. I'm aware that Transformers is a summer blockbuster and is supposed to be lighthearted fun so I can forgive it the terrible and clichéd romance between the beauty and the geek and the many corny lines but it kept throwing so many curve balls my way I couldn't ignore the many flaws and eventually I switched off the DVD. I neither know, nor care, how it ended. Why do I think it was so bad? There is the complete absence of a story. Robots come to earth and fight, the end. The acting went from mediocre to bad. When the robots are finally introduced the movie changes tone from semi serious mood to wise cracking silly antics  jarringly. The various Transformers are introduced in a sloppy, and anything but memorable manner, which shows what a clumsy director Michael Bay is. The robots themselves are badly designed and 'transform' in an abstract blur of fancy CGI only to distract that there is no cohesive design  there is a truck, spinning CGI, then there is a robot, they do not actually transform at all. The cheap plastic toys you could get in the 80s were more impressively designed. The flashy but inadequate robot design meant the fight sequences were an unchoreographed mess that completely lacked tension. On top of that there is a shocking approach to casual violence which is surprising considering Steven Spielberg's recent outburst against violence on TV. A man is flicked aside against a car which would obviously kill him for a throw away gag. A building is ripped through by two fighting robots as you see people running around on the various floors before they die. I'm guessing Bay thought it would be clever to see such detail but I felt it was gratuitous and sickening. Other utterly ridiculous ideas are weak but when the giant pyramid of Giza size cube folds itself up into a Rubix cube size key ornament my common sense just wanted to bail out of the movie altogether. I know it's only a movie and I shouldn't even be thinking about physics, I know the average age watching the movie wouldn't be bothered, and I'm no science geek but it is just so impossible for that much mass to disappear and I just had to laugh at the concept. The robots have such little 'humanity' in their personalities that during the 'death sequence' I really couldn't have cared less. At the final fight sequence I was so bored, as I said earlier, I just switched off the DVD and went to bed. The Worst FIlm Ever Made isn't hyperbole, Michael Bay worked hard to earn that credit. Because for some reason I felt as if I were watching a deranged 144 minute "Victoria's Secret models meets Chevy Car Company Robots" commercial. I knew the movie would be bad, I just never thought that it would be THAT bad. I'm a pretty open minded person, I can live with a few plot holes in the story, even some cheesy lines thrown here and there, (I watched ID4 for God's sake). This movie just defies all of that ... I have never wanted to leave the theater as much as I did that night.I can't explain it ... I am upset about sitting there for over two hours and watching this travesty. I am upset about contributing to the gross for opening weekend. I am upset about watching a Michael Bay film. But overall, I think that I am just upset that this movie just really, really sucked. The special effects were good but even they couldn't save the movie. They couldn't save the horrible acting, they couldn't save the lack of story ... everything is one dimensional and I just didn't care about anything or anybody. The ending battle dragged, there was no suspense, there was no emotion ... truly a waste of time. This new transformers movie may possibly be the worst movie i've ever seen. I went into this movie expecting to see a good action movie with a pretty bad plot. Boy was I disappointed. The over top humor that is wedged into the movie at every possible second coupled with the incredibly annoying and uninteresting back story of our "heros" makes it impossible for the actual Transformers, which did look really cool, to pull this movie out of the garbage. The Transormers themselves looked great and when they actually fought each other, between peeing on people and making ridiculous jokes, it was fun. But those few minutes of enjoyment can't save the movie.I'm 32 and I've loved transformers most of my life. I was really hoping that this movie would do them justice, but it doesn't. The movie is impossible to take seriously on any level. Largely because of the "Jar Jar Binks" transformer that is running around through out the entire movie and the other endless "comedic" moments. I hope you, reader, enjoy the movie more than I did. When watching the movie ask yourself one question. Why would they relocate the climatic battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons from the safety of an isolated desert to a large city filled with innocent lives. It doesn't make sense. This movie is very BAD, but I bet you're gonna watch it anyways This has to be the most disappointing movie I've watched this year. What a let down! It's probably up there with great franchise flops like Dungeon & Dragons (which was really really bad) and Terminator 3 which was nowhere close to the very much dated T1 & T2.Sure, I understand this Transformers is a Michael Bay Transformers (made 2007 and not 1980s) it shd be different .yes yes but almost everything lacked character!I guess what I wanna say is a good movie is timeless. It tells a good story and leaves deep impression in the audience. 50 years from now, you may tell people about an excellent movie you've watched in 2007, but it's probably NOT Transformers.If you are a 5-year old kid, you may like the movie. If you are an adult with no great expectations, you may find it visually entertaining. If you are a Transformers fan I suggest not watching it cos it may spoil your day, as it did with mine. But you probably are gonna watch it anyways as I did cos it's TRANSFORMERS tsk tsk ☹ Im sorry, i no ill get slated to hell for this but every single person who gave this film anything more than a 5 out of 10 is clearly delusional and need serious mental help immediately for the sake of the planet and the universe at large! I don't dislike that many films I'm usually quite easy to please but this film was easily one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to sit through! It started out so well  that initial sequence in the army base was amazing and I was captivated  i expected so much after that and then it just died  much like I wished I would so i would have to see or hear any more of it! This film was exceptional for being one of the few that actually didn't work on any level at all! The plot was paper thin at best and I'm sorry but the largest part of the film was nothing more than filler! SECTOR 7!!!!!! OMG Christ on a bike what was that about!!! Seriously!!! It was the most ridiculous piece of anti American diatribe that I have ever seen and the thin veil of anti American feeling that surrounded these idiotic characters was nothing less than disgusting! Are we really meant to believe that the highest level of American security is entrusted to someone that would make a t-shirt like that for themselves  seriously  what was realistic about that or funny for that matter! People who thought that was funny are very easily amused! Then there was the notable lack of a President! Again, are we actually supposed to believe that during a time of extreme crisis that the President wouldn't be at the helm taking control? Again the anti American/anti Bush feeling in this film was well over the score and completely unnecessary in this film! If you want to take a shot at Bush do what Moore does and do it upfront and in person and don't ruin perfectly good films for it! Then there's Megatron! How, pray tell, did the generally primitive people of the world manage to transport this huge lumbering behemoth from deep below the arctic ice to somewhere in America (Hoover Dam wasn't built until the 1930s) given how large and heavy he would be  and how did they keep him frozen during this time without the obvious aid of cryogenics. It may be a small gripe but its part of the huge number of inconsistencies that exist in this film! The scene outside Sam's house is painful  giant robots playing hide and go seek  I actually thought I smelled the BS during that scene  not only was it excruciatingly painful but it was far too long! This could have been such an amazing film and MICHAEL BAY destroyed it  not only that he destroyed the film, raped its mother, pi*sed all over its dad and systematically mutilated all of its siblings! And, it should not be forgotten that Spielberg was involved in this  I can only think he was asleep the whole time! I can only hope that they bring in Bryan Singer or someone who actually knows what they're doing with this kind of film and chain Bay to the underside of a boat and leave him there to rot and not ruin any more potentially fantastic films! PS wow that was scathing wasn't it  honestly I hated the film but I've read too many high and mighty comments from people who said they loved it and slated those that hated it! If there are police officers reading this I promise I have no intention of chaining Michael Bay to the underside of a boat please don't arrest me LOL! Yes, I loved Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but Steven Spielberg is the executive producers of garbage flicks like War of the Worlds and AI, both testimonials to lavish over-budgeting and plot less rambling in scriptwriting. Well, I guess he put Michael Bay in front of this over-bloated silly mess, Transformers, so that he could be the crap shield.This movie is the war sequence we wanted but were denied in War of the Worlds, played in over-sized, out-of-focus for the most part, and boringly-repeated fashion, between the "good" Autobots and the "evil" Decepticons who are after a source of unlimited power that landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and discovered by the grandfather of soon- to-be-metro-sexual-wimp Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf. Apparently the map of the location of this "Allspark" is etched on his grandfather's glasses, which he possesses.At any rate, through twist of fate, Sam obtains a car, which is an Autobot in disguise, and picks up a jock-chasing chick Mikaela Banes, played by Megan Fox. From that point on, the movie is a mindless array of action sequences as the Decepticons make their way to Earth and attempt to cripple all defense and communications prior to a battle with the Autobots.My main problem with this film is that it spends virtually all its time in overblown (and out of screen scope) CGI action sequences that are either too close up to fully comprehend or almost too fast to make any sense of. John Voight is wasted in the role of the Secretary of Defense, choosing to take the paycheck and act like a slightly-intellectual hard-headed redneck bureaucrat instead of playing an interesting character.The rest of the performances by cast are really unmemorable, and the action sequences are just a jumbled mess. The other annoying aspect of this film is that it is a virtual commercial for Chevrolet, Taco Bell, and every other kind of franchise item (candy, tools, and cars), and the actors use their names with great repetition. I have to assume that the executive producer of this film (no stranger of cliché ad usage, remember Reese's Pieces in E.T.?) was banking on merchandising revenues if the film failed at the box office.In the end, it is another brainless, mindless thrill ride we expect from Spielberg. Thank God he has Michael Bay to point the finger of blame should this thing fail. This movie has the indelible mark of the ultimate King of Cinema Crap, Steven Spielberg, and has a similar feel of his "epic" action films.I would not even bother renting this one. It really is not worth the viewers time. As nigh unto impossible as it may seem, the master of Second Unit Cinema- none other than Mr. Michael "Oy vey" Bay- has rocketed to the top of the charts with his take on the old TRANSFORMERS toytoons. (I was one of those who watched the original series when it aired because, even though it wasn't- nor isn't, nor ever shall be- food for thought, it beat the daylights- then, as even now, believe it or not- out of the infinitely inferior Americanimation to be found on the tube... or even on the Big Screen, for the most part... again, to this very day.) Even Second Unit Cinemasters like Tim Story (whose FANTASTIC BOREs run a close second and third to TRANSFORMERS) can't begin to come close to what Mr. Bay has wrought. Bay, unlike Story, at least had the good sense to go with a full cgi cast and thereby save himself the embarrassment of working with real, live human beings. (One of the cgi even looks like Angelina Jolie's father. The geniuses who generated these computer images must take a bow- as should their computers, who did most of the work, anyway.) By handing the reins of most of the film over to the techs, Bay frees himself up to do what he does best: direct the second unit. It was nothing less than a stroke of genius. If there's another director more worthy of the title of Master Of Second Unit Cinema than Bay, I've missed him. Pardon me if this review comes out as somewhat unorganized. It's just that all of my thoughts are currently jumbling together because of how bad this movie really is.This is by far the worst movie of the year. It's bad, even for Michael Bay. Whoever said earlier that the action shots were full of too many zooms, kudos to them because they are right on the money. My friend nearly puked a little when they played music from "Kill Bill Vol 1" in it. Another problem I had with it was that it kept changing from day to night at random when it was obviously a continuation of the same scene. John Turturro was highly miscast in the movie, as well as Jon Voit. Please, don't waste your time. It's awful. It makes me ashamed to be an American. "The Triumph of Will" was a Nazi propaganda movie that brainwashed millions of people into believing that the Nazi's were fighting for a just cause; that's still not half as bad as "transformers." I even refuse to capitalize "transformers" because it is so rotten.PS - QUIT RATING THE MOVIE TEN STARS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!!!

WE SURE DO. Well watch us to list everything over 2 hours. You'll love it. I just had my intelligence insulted for a blistering 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know who this movie is for, but it's not for fans of the book. It's a beautiful movie that ruins itself with horrible pacing and non-existent character development.My favorite part is at the end when they casually collapse the world economy two times a week because Spielberg's kids need a life lesson on putting their cell phones down. I know. Every movie does not tell the full story of a book. 
But when I watched the trailers, I already saw that the movie was far, faaaaar away from the book.
Now I watched the movie and my worst fears became reality.What is left over from the book:
The title
Names of the characters (except for Shoto)
That it is about an Easter egg hunt in the OASIS.
More or less the concept of the OASIS.
The colors of the keys and gates incl. the points you get for the gates.
That Aech is driving a truck. 
Wade has his rig (but not the one from the movie) in a scrapyard truck.
IOI is evil. 
Everyone else is good.What was left out:
About everything what you liked from the book, like Wargames, Dungeons and Dragons, Rush, Joust, in fact every arcade game, Pac Man, ...What is different from the book:
Everything!This movie is created for an audience younger than 20 years, who has no idea about the 80s or would understand any references from that time.
To be clear, the whole OASIS is not only 80s, but the Easter egg hunt is.
Also the deaths that happen in the book were removed to have the young audience not to be confronted with the harsh methods from IOI.All characters are and behave totally differently.
Aech is in the book a badass who knows his stuff, not that whiney character in the movie.
Wade is a kid who has no money, IRL and in the OASIS, so no DeLorean from the start.
He starts the hunt with a level 1 sword, shield and leather body armor. 
Art3mis is a chubby girl (would have been great to see that in the movie). So why is Spielberg putting his money on a skinny girl? Great move to give the one chance away to put some self-esteem in non-perfect people.
I-R0k is a stupid looser in the book, not that super strong headhunter.
Really? IOI employees applaud when Wade opens the final gate?!The 80s references used in the movie have nothing in common with the ones from the book. 
But not always the obvious 80s references are the best ones, there are many hidden treasures in the book.
Mr. Spielberg, learn something from Marvel, they used "Lake Shore Drive" in the soundtrack... think about it.
A great movie might have really started an 80s nostalgia boost. But you killed it. What was stolen from other movies:
The OASIS simulation inside the OASIS simulation, from Inception. 
The place around the castle with the lava and high voltage bursts, from Star Wars III.
Rig suits, strongly inspired by Tron Legacy.
I-R0k made like a very cheap Boba-Fett-headhunter-copy, again Star Wars.
Iron Giant raising the thumb while melting in the lava, from Terminator II - Judgement day (when was that? right 1991).In conclusion: 
Mr. Spielberg, you are old enough, you have enough money. Please retire. You lost it long ago.
Maybe you can write a children's book, and watch it getting ripped to pieces by some amateur director, who makes a movie from your book. For the viewers:
If you loved the book. Stay far away from that movie. Never ever watch it. 
You will only scream in frustration, like I did. 
If you have not read the book and you have 2.5 hrs and the money to spare, you can watch it. Maybe you will enjoy it.
But as many others wrote, it is a straight forward plot, cheesy scenes, mediocre story, lame jokes. I don't know how they kept Ernest Cline quiet. It must have either involved a lot of money or threatening him to sue. How else would you silently watch how your hard work gets so destroyed. This is up there with Crystal Skull and Lost World as one of Spielberg's biggest turds. So so bad. For starters this is nothing like the book. The book is all about the details and this adaptation totally misses those. The dialogue was by the numbers. Lots of exposition and at times flat out cheesy. Lots of tell, very little show. Little to no character development. Wade has zero arc in the movie. He's just kind of there. Nothing made me really care for him. I found myself bored many times and the only times I laughed where when I couldn't believe how comically bad this was. Massive disappointment. This is the most pandering movie I've ever seen. Nostalgia doesn't make up for an awful and predictable plot, Terrible acting, and Ham-fisted references. Super boring and predictable, the movie is parasitizing on gamers nostalgia and that's it. The writer of RP1 needs to take a lesson in script writing. The dialogue in this movie is horrific, it is unbelievable and subsequently makes every single character unbelievable and their relationships meaningless. The Shining scene was the only moment I sat up from my slumped state and take my headphones out and even then i was disappointed at everything escaped the scoring which was taken directly from the shining aka a better film. The visuals were nice enough but nothing could bring this movie out if the "look how cool the 80's were" garbage fire it was. Why make a movie based on a book, and change literally every aspect of the book?? I know movies aren't going to be exactly like the books, but this is ridiculous. All over the place. Terrible character development, even worse dialogue. The cgi is awful. For being an immersive digital world supposedly thirty years or so from now, the oasis looks cheap and a lot like something animated by Pixar in the early 2000s. Predictable and boring. 40 minutes too long. Thought about leaving a half hour in, afterwards I was mad I didn't. I just kept thinking it would get better. It. Did. Not. Just walked out of the cinema as I got incredibly frustrated with the movie. The acting was terrible, the story line was completely butchered and the visual effects were rather unimaginative. Whilst I knew from the beginning that it was not a word for word remake of the brilliant book that is Ready Player One, but to butcher the plot this badly is just criminal. The creators of this movie managed to take a fascinating world and box it into a small maggot infested tin of sardines. What a pile of Hollywood rubbish! If you're looking for anything fun from the book, it's probably gone. Your favorite scene or part of the story line regarding the hunt for the keys and search for clues is GONE! Everything is GONE! Forget RUSH, Joust, ZORK, Lich King, Blade Runner, ALL GONE! A very sad screenplay for such a wonderful book. All these people saying get over it because it's a movie and not a book are full of it. Why would you name the movie after an actual book if you were going to literally change every single detail except the names?!?! That makes no sense. Such a disappointment. Keeping this review simple:
1. Almost all of the scenes in the Oasis look AWFUL. Either cartoony or incoherent. There may be a million "cameos" but I could barely pick out more then 3. Every thing is dark, colorless and blurry. Action scenes are impossible to follow.
2. The acting is terrible and wooden all around. Forced jokes (literally no one in my theater laughed once) with bad delivery. 
3. It's like it was written and directed by someone who talked to someone who sorta read the book like 10 years ago. Maybe 10% of the book is in there. If you have a favorite part of the book, it ain't in this movie. None of the details that made the story cool or make sense at all appear in this film.
4. The story and dialogue seem like they written by a 12 year old. Boy meets girl, 10 seconds later boy loves girl. Girl pushes him away, 10 seconds later girl loves boy. Boy says lines like : "Fanboys know haters!"
This movie was a genuine P.O.S. from writing, to acting, to directing to effects. I hate to say, but it did not have a single redeeming quality. And FYI - the Iron Giant is in like 3 minutes of the movie (2 minutes of which already appear in the commercials). My family enjoyed reading the book and laughed and were excited all the way through - so we were thrilled to hear that Spielberg was directing the movie!Oh my gosh - I almost walked out, and would have if I wasn't with my family. A let down in almost every single way, from 80's classic references deleted to interjections of horror that should have never been there. Wow, almost every single thing that was exciting about the book was destroyed in this movie. I wrote this review to save the people's money and time who haven't yet seen it. ... I can't remember the last time I stopped a film before it ended! I did not care the least where this film was going and bailed after 40 minutes... I'm no movie critic, and I will not go in to any details here....:
I will simply sum up my experience. 
I'm 45 years old, and have been to countless movies...
This is the first and ONLY movie I have watched in my entire life where I fell asleep midway watching it... The way the characters were built in the book, the sacrifice that some of them made is all lost by the film version.This is not about struggle, challenge and self discovery but rather a lack luster kids version of the story that is so simple and basic that everything that made the book so complexly simple is just gone...My girlfriend and I for the first time in our 6 year relationship actually thought about leaving the cinema halfway through for the first time.The delivery of this film just makes us so sad. If you liked the book, then you will probably want to walk out of the theater. This is the worst book to movie adaptation I've ever seen and I'm really not exaggerating. I'm so disappointed. I was so excited about this and it let me down in every way except visually. Take everything about the novel and change it to something less interesting and cheesy and this is what you get. A wonderful modern throwback novel full of creative nostalgia and incredibly compelling characters that gets so mucked around in Hollywood movie filth that what you get on the big screen doesn't even remotely resemble the novel at all. If you're looking for anything fun from the book, it's probably gone. Your favorite scene or part of the story line regarding the hunt for the keys and search for clues is GONE! Everything is GONE! Forget RUSH, Joust, ZORK, Lich King, Blade Runner, ALL GONE! A very sad screenplay for such a wonderful book. On the other hand, if you didn't read the book and have no expectations going in.......it still stinks! :( A let down on the scale of Eragon and Avatar the last airbender. This movie twists the book and concepts to a point that it doesn't deserve the name. If you were a lover of this book, don't waste your time or money. While this movie is full of cinematic wonder, that is really where the magic stops. Spielberg sadly took a great book, ripped off the cover, and stuck it on a completely different story. There is no drama, no tension and largely not a lot a story. He did the same thing to Jurassic Park. I was truly disappointed. It started out so well, and then it spun out of control. The only reason I didn't walk out after the first half-an-hour was because I'd taken a friend and it would have been rude to storm out and leave them sat alone. They only came because I'd raved about how great the book was, and how great the movie was going to be. My friend was largely confused, and all I could do was apologise for wasting two hours and twenty minutes of their time.This travesty was made worse because Empire magazine had said that it was a close fit to the book. Shame on Mr Cline, who wrote the book, and also wrote this script. I can't believe an author would do such a spectacular hatchet job on his own material (maybe the blood rushing down the hotel corridor came from all the fans who committed suicide when the saw the prescreening). I wanted this movie to be so much more than it was. And I have no doubt that anyone who is ignorant of the book will find it amusing. But they really shouldn't think too hard otherwise they will spot all the inconsistencies. Like how artimus has the landline numbers for all the five players when they are all keeping their identities secret. Sadly I don't own a working delorian with functioning time-travel to enable me to go back to yesterday and tell me to not buy the tickets. This joins the only other movie that I will never watch again. The remake of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy (which is amongst my all time favourite stories). Did Steven Spielberg even read this book! So much of the story was altered from the book that it made watching this movie very painful and frustrating. It seems that the movie was made for a different generation rather than the audience that fell in love with the book. Take a note from Peter Jackson when making a movie from a book. I understand that parts will be altered and some parts left out. Making a movie from a book is challenging I am sure. Just don't rewrite it! Even Ridley Scott did better with the Martian. He missed the mark on the humor in the Martian but at least he told the story as the author had written. If you love the book, you will hate this movie. I was beyond disappointed after seeing Ready Player One last night. It is a shadow of the book with barely enough to use the name.If you are a purest and love the book, I do not recommend this movie. If you are a fan of the genre and just want to go see it from that perspective, purge the book from your mind and go.I am disappointed in Steve Spielberg and more so in Ernest Cline for allowing this to happen. Rushed and glossed over the elements that made this a good story. 
Not sure why you would bother adapting a story at all if you don't plan on using the majority of the best parts. 
Don't bother with the movie read the book. I was very excited for this film, it being one of my favourite books of all time but I have to give it 1 star for the main reason that Spielberg has ruined this. The premise is exactly the same but he has lost the whole 80's culture from the book, all the references and jokes. They have squashed it right down and lost the feel for it. The film would have been better as a trilogy. Would have made more sense and more money for the studio. The way the keys were "found" were a joke, any modern pop culture reference that is popular just now he threw in there for no reason at all and threw in a kiss for the love story side of things. I'm not by any means a purist, but this movie COMPLETELY hacks up everything good about the books. It's as if Steven Spielberg, Zak Penn, and even Ernest Cline, the author, hadn't even read the book at all. All theee of them owe fans an apology. Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.
I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix. This movie was a joke,average superhero movie where the heroes win and everyone's happy, hounestly zero dialogue this whole thing is just liked because marvel is ending, this movie made people "cry"?really?the only thing that made me cry was my money I spent on seeing this garbage, thor was ruined along with hulk, thanks was dumber down,and capitain marvels horrible scenes were pain full to sit through,hounestly I'm glad people are coming to their senses and rating this movie lower now that they rewatch it, it's full of plot holes and the time travel is embarrassing lazy writing that's a disgrace to real time travel movies,besides the hype this movie had nothing it was 100% hypebased in fact I dont think anyone acctually paid attention to the movie, the ending was extremely predictable and the final battle was bland with the only background colors being brown and destroyed ships so disapointing after the amazing movie that showed that superhero movies can be more then saving the day and the bad guys losing There are endles topics, the sci-fi universe could be so immensely diverse, but only the pure greed and the striving for money making lets us 1v1 with THIS.Why dont we take the top Nebula/Hugo winning scenarios? Because we obviously perceive our viewer through the prism of arrogance and dont evend dare to waste corporate budgets on something worthy.Such a waste of time, ressources and such a stamp on Marvel.Bad, just bad. This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say "hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.This should be buried in a pit for future generations marked "stop watching after Age of Ultron" Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for... Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie.
The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me. As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior "Infinity War". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie. It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat. How can Marvel, the Russo brothers as well as the scriptwriters go from delivering the best superhero movie ever made, Avengers Infinity War, to offering such trite tosh as Endgame? I was so disappointed that I almost threw up. I suspect at the end of the day they ran out of ideas and thought its gonna be a great way to fool us fans by offering us the final movie to make an extra billion by putting together what seemed like the worst outtakes of a b unit.! Worst movie i saw this year boring mess,plot holes,too cheesy,bad writing I did not care for a single second of what was really happening. Too much emphasis on certain characters while others are left in just to make it seem more "epic". Hulk was the only character of any entertainment value. I was more entertained by the audiences reaction to certain scenes than the actual film. The scene where Black Widow dies, the girl behind me whispered to her friend: "Is she dead?" Like no s*** you just saw her fall of a cliff and slam on the ground.Besides the 30 minute battle, how they handled Tony Stark's death was well done, especially the funeral. If they ended on that long shot showing all the characters, then I would of liked it a little more, but it just kept going.It bored me to death. I only saw it because on how it was considered a "cinematic event" to most. To the lovers of film, I really don't recommend it. Just wait for the final battle to be put up on YouTube or something and watch that. One of the best comic book movie villains was ruined.
Who writes this thing? Time travel? Really? Result:
Film full of plot holes.
Unsatisfying deaths of main characters Tony and Natasha.
Previously cool - now ruined characters Thor and Hulk.
I feel like Thanos today. What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎 I really liked Infinity war,but endgame is so much boring.
Thor and Hulk were totally wasted.Average CGI and actions.Some dialogues felt forced and totally
unnecessary.I expected more from marvel.
The Infinity war ending was much better and epic.I will take endgame as an alternate ending The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating "a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side" to which Black Widow replies "I will throw this sandwich at you". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing. I had to give this 1 star as it's not possible to give it less. Having avoided it at the Cinema because i knew it was a lost cause i finally watched it tonight......
Why does Thor have 2 functioning eyes? Having been told in Guardians of the galaxy that no one can hold an infinity stone and survive, suddenly everyone can now hold one? Where is the continuity in these films? Luckily this is the last we will ever see of this franchise! Until someone decides to do a remake as there are no original ideas anymore. J.J.Abrams you now have more films to ruin 👍🏻 Ant man didn't even go up thanos's ass. i sat through three hours of movie and paul rudd did not go up purple alien butthole It was a long time ago that i saw a movie this bad. It was a mix of Grease, Dirty Dancing and Star Wars combined. The endless tear-pulling scenes with heavy music and long faces. Storylines bouncing from left to right. At one point all wizards, superheros and comic heros came out of nowere to help fight the bad guy. It made no sense whatsoever. You have to be under 11 to appriacte this story. Sesame Street is a philosophical and deep story in comparison to this bad excuse for a movie. I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU "isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to. I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess. This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt. Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film Spectacle and nothing else
as fans said here its meant to be for them but even they dont like it
totally undermines the excellent previous movies for too much fanservice and useless plot threads that go nowhere
sadly ive seen this movie twice and regretted it both times
such a slack way to wrap up what was mostly a good-excellent run of movies Guardians of the Galaxy is just another mediocre film. Under the pretence of future, it sneaked in embraces of the past. Perhaps it tried to be both, but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy. It failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me. Its humour was out of context. There were too many characters, most of which were not properly developed. The purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing. I'll comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs.Someone commented that the films like the Dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful. That person further commented that this film, Guardians of the Galaxy challenged this standard. I generally don't like dogmas. But here it's not at all about dogmas. It is just the fact that those "deep" ones could trigger deeper emotions, or provoke thoughts, or inspire the audiences, or help the audiences learn something, or help the audiences learn themselves better. By these, the audiences like, think about, involuntarily recall, remember and give high scores for those "deep" films. Of course different people have different opinions on deepness. So, I don't comment on the deepness of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just commenting on triggering deeper emotions, or provoking thoughts, or inspiring me, or helping me learn something or learn myself better, unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy did none of these to me. So, it just didn't make me feel that way, that it was one of those all-time great films.Someone commented that Guardians of the Galaxy was not a serious film, but rather, it was a great, light-hearted comedy. Even for this, I don't think I could agree. Great humour exists in context. In the right context, something plain could be hilarious. Out of context, brilliant jokes were just nothing. In Guardians of the Galaxy, too much humour ran out of context. For example, the raccoon said later, that he asked for one prisoner's prosthetic leg was just a joke. What did this convey? It was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? No. How about it tried to portray a figure, the raccoon, who was unfazed in front of great danger? But then you had to make the situation look dangerous. Even in The Wizard of Oz (1939), the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison. The prison here felt just like a noisy second-hand market. So, I didn't find the joke funny and didn't know why it was in the film otherwise either. There were many such lines. I knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh, but I just didn't feel that entertained at those improper moments.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy has no place on the all-time great list. Perhaps it was the last joke it could play, on itself, being put into the Top 250 list. Among those great films, its mediocrity would just manifest itself. Just within the first month of its release, it dropped 20 places on the Top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th. As time goes on, this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge. There are great films, like In the Name of the Father (1993), A Beautiful Mind (2001) etc. They were not on the Top 250 list before, but gradually rose up and emerged into the all-time great list. Just on the contrary, Guardians of the Galaxy will gradually drop out of the Top 250 list. I thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star, even though it's maybe - at BEST - a 4, because this is definitely not worth 8. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a shot I chose to try in god knows how long since I've been to the cinema. This is just another load of Hollywood trash. I had the impression it was innovative, considering the Guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing... but I was wrong...IN THE BEGINNING, what's-his-name is on Earth and it is APPARENTLY '88. The kid's mother dies. OK. Is this meant to be emotional despite the fact I have no attachment to any of these characters yet? OH WOW IT'S THE FUTURE NOW!! I'm sorry; his mother dies, he goes outside and then he gets abducted? What is this supposed to signify? Not to mention it's (obviously) unbelievably and strangely timed, but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character, but really doesn't do ANYTHING for the major plot of the entire film.The rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison (because what happens when you're arrested together is you share a block, not to mention gender is no issue here). Then they fall into this orb situation. What is it? It.. it is this orb.. and it is powerful.. a bit like the cube or something. There was little development in the story at all really, a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising. I don't even know, I was almost asleep half the time. I was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over.So we have hideous CGI here. Ridiculously unprofessional, but I guess I'm not in with the CGI in blockbusters. They have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems; having the ability to do these things doesn't make it cool, it just looks like a video game. Another thing, visually, was the designs. It was just so typical of the action/sci-fi genre in the technology and whatnot, and the characters... very much in the same boat but more-so thrown together effortlessly.Then after that its all EXPLOSIONS - SPEEDING - ADVERTISING - HITTING! In between there's a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe. The best kind. And in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay.OVERALL: >The comedy was... horrid... >The story was simple. >The characters were lacking in... everything really. -The cinematography didn't even involve cameras. >The soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together. So what was good about it? The ACTION!!!1111 Wait, no... >The action was too much, unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time. Main reason I even saw this was I received an invitation from some mates. I think I'll try go back to sticking to films with a point. The only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucks. The movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those. Huge mistake.To say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.The story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.Visual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the only positive thing that I can say about the movie.The theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.The only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and sock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewers. As a fan of Marvel movies I was excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy. However, this movie failed on several levels.It is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny. I genuinely laughed once. Furthermore, one 'joke' was weirdly inappropriate.The story is completely generic. It seems like they just needed some story, any story, as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny.I wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big set-piece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out. This was done in the Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness. To me, it's like directors have to have this '9/11' shot in every movie (big thing crashes into buildings) and it has to stop. It's boring now.The only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds.It seems that Marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack. I will approach the next Marvel with extreme caution, and I will not see Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn't mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichés extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it's Marvel, what could go wrong? It's sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichés...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of "saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just Earth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a cliché-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure.So, plot: Would have been old and good but it wasn't. Protagonists: I would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didn't blow up almost everyone's favorite guy and kept alive some people's least-liked guy(s). So, yeah. Villains: ... oh my gosh, no, seriously? What even happened to the evil robot woman? Did the filmmakers just completely forget her? Music: Louder than Inception's horn. And I loved that even though it had no tune. Couldn't stand this though. But still, be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that I would have downloaded if they didn't play those songs during totally inappropriate moments. Comedy relief my butt. The only relief I got out of the soundtrack that isn't even their soundtrack -hopefully they didn't violate any copy rights... I mean, if it's these filmmakers, I wouldn't be surprised- is that I'm glad Groot enjoyed himself. Visuals: Stunning. That wasn't sarcastic at all. At all. What else? Oh yeah, unless you pay me a million dollars, I would never watch the sequel. So sorry I can't contribute ten dollars for Marvel next time. Tough luck.Don't let this review stop you though. Most of my friends liked it. And of course, most people who reviewed this movie liked it, so I guess I'm just a jerk. I'm betting you readers agree, and that's totally understandable since I am totally venting. But hey, three out of four of my friends never watched a Marvel movie so... call me bluffing, but I sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments I have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life.... I'm still going to watch X-men though. Dang you, Marvel. Such an awful wreck! There I said it. These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a "fantastic" and "great" and "awesome" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The "Ten out of Ten" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand what you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say..."okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's humanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista as Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall performance (if any) Why? Well, you'll be sharing this characters maniacal laughter once you've realized you wasted valuable devotion for a franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions rather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his quirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect trio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the threatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT COULD GO WRONG...oh I don't know... Let's start predicting before we start watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It's PG-13, so no, but is there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a film! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZEROIf you expect a disappointment, you're welcome. If you're an oblivious fanatic that just loves hearing and reading the same regurgitated lines, you're in for a whirlwind!Good Luck Marvel in your festival of delusion! May the farce be with you! If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then, after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley Kubrick. This film was like the story of " The Emperor's New Clothes", where the con artists create an invisible suit and just to fit in everyone in the village inducing the king say they like the suit. Parts of the film were enjoyable and the film BUT this film is not better than the 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bicycle Thief, Rashamon, Toy Story, Chinatown, Up, Pan's Labyrinth, The Hunt, Ikuru, Good Will Hunting, Blade Runner, Rebecca, Casino, V for Vendetta, Fargo, Trainspotting, Into the wild, Dial M for Murder, The Sixth Sense, The Thing, No Country for Old Men, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Incendies, Network, Diabolique, There Will Be Blood, Amores Perros, The Wizard of Oz, Million Dollar Baby, The Avengers, he Bourne Ultimatum, Strangers on a Train, Twelve Monkeys, Notorious, The King's Speech, The Terminator, Rocky, Dog Day Afternoon, Monsters, Inc., Memories of Murder, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Die Hard, etc So - my son and I went to watch GotG. After reading mixed reviews we were skeptical but curious. The bad reviews unfortunately were right. The movie has no story line, stupid characters (like a talking raccoon) and more bad language than most rated R films I have seen. The producers were trying to cover the lack of plot with senseless action scenes that all seemed random and disconnected. Do yourself a favor and save the money you spend - you will get more pleasure from a big cup of ice cream. I can't believe Glenn Close and Vin Diesel took even small roles in this.My sons' quote: " I totally agree with my dad. There was no point in making this movie. The movie is overly dramatic for instance; in the beginning of the movie Starlords mom dies from cancer and she asked him to hold her hand while she dies, and he looks away and cries. Then after she dies he runs out of the hospital and gets kidnapped by aliens. The characters are really badly made, like the evil blue dude who has a half robot daughter that just stands around him like an eavesdropping servant or the madman who just tries to kill Ronan - so a lot of this movie is stupid. We left the theater half way through. I love good superhero films, Captain America, Superman, Iron Man. This is not one of them. If I"d been alone I would have walked out and the last time I did that in a cinema was for The Wedding Singer.It's not without merit but with $170 million spent, I would hope not. The design overall is very good, the effects also and unlike some I liked Chris Pratt and the Ronan actor. But the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon character's grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes.The film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste. But at least it does not take itself seriously, we are thankful for small mercies.Enough said, I will go out of my way to avoid James Gunn films in future. I am struggling to understand why fans found this movie so good. Perhaps it's just recent yet and, in time, people will figure out their mistake.Let's face it, the plot is ridiculous, working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy, when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment. Plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like we've seen them before but we don't really remember where from, well maybe another movie, like The Collector, Nova Prime or Korath. And many, many clichés.But the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes. I couldn't laugh even once and I do tend to have a good sense of humor. The joke about slipping the finger on your neck - really?! And Rocket demanding a man's artificial leg for nothing, to say later that that was a joke - absolutely unnecessary. On top of its nonsense, the final scene: Ronan is about to finally get his revenge, has the power to do so, is about to do so, then, at the very last moment, he stops to watch Quill dancing (while others prepare to blast him). Oh, forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire, the one driving my whole life and existence, let's just stop and watch him dance... seriously? Was that supposed to be funny? Am I a ten-year-old boy watching Woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene. What a great plot indeed. Maybe I could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain, with lights and sound, but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children.One very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful CGI images, not all, but many, specially those from space and star wars-like spaceship battles.Every single other Marvel movie was better than this - and not all were exactly good. If the sequence is going to be as good as the first one, please don't even start it, Marvel.And, not to forget, some one has to tell Nasa that, to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth, you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves... awesome! Mindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else, Guardians delivers none of that. Throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script. I've never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of Guardians is just so hilariously god-awful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits.Oh Christ, what a forgettable, uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was. I suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but I struggle to see how, there's hardly any character development, the plot is nonsense from start to finish, the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce Thanos (who is a big deal I'm assuming?) and it's all just so damn predictable. Perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired "power of love" trope.I may have given Guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it, but none of that is to be found here. The First paragraph of this review consists of exposition. If a potential reader wishes to read about my opinion on the movie, skipping to the second paragraph is advisable. It's been about two years since I saw this movie at the cinema - something is compelled me to organize my thoughts and write this now. Why? I'm not entirely sure, I guess "Guardians Of The Galaxy" was always kind of an enigma to me. How could a movie so inept in everything it tries to do be so praised? It's not your typical Michael Bay-esque Hollywood cookie-cutter garbage, so It's success can't be attributed to following the same, overused, cliché-infested formulas. It could be that I am insane in my own specific way, but outside of production value I found no redeeming qualities here. I know the movie is an adaptation (of sorts) of a comic book series. My knowledge of comics is incredibly limited, so I'm judging this thing on it's own merits."Guardians Of The Galaxy" reminded me of one of those sci-fi stories I would come up with when I was 10-13 years old. It was a favorite pastime of mine, coming up with characters, who were blatant rip-offs of others from franchises I enjoyed at the time, putting them in nonsensical situations (of course, to 12 year old me it all made perfect sense) and just admiring my creation as any narcissistic child would. Of course, my stories didn't have movie adaptations with astronomical budgets.I compared "Guardians Of The Galaxy" to a child's sci-fi story because of it's complete lack of direction - too many plot lines (more akin to plot doodles) that are individually unrefined and irrelevant to the overall story, which somehow manages to be even more undefinable. It's like a space opera chopped up and stitched together in some horribly messed up jigsaw puzzle. Now, some movies thrive on a lack of continuity and direction (Tarantino practically mastered that form of film-making), but this specimen is different. Again, it's as if the script was written by a child and the whole thing was directed by some individual who somehow had the skill of a top-notch director, but again possessed the mindset of a 12 year old.What's even more surreal about the whole thing is that it feels incredibly solid - it's not "The Room" where every seen is irrelevant, because of the writer/director's sheer incompetence. Somehow, "Guardians..." holds itself together quite well, again everything else is top notch: Excellent CGI, detailed land/spacescapes (albeit of unoriginal, uninspired design) and pretty good acting with some minor exceptions. As I said before, this movie doesn't play out like a typical Hollywood schlockfest would - there are too many plot lines and too much time is devoted to character development - if this was typical garbage, we would have had a lot more action scenes and female characters in suggestive positions. All these attempts at complexity feel sincere, again, it's like a child trying to do his best, but they have no purpose. To illustrate: why should it matter that the green chick and the blue chick (sorry, too lazy to look up names) are sisters - it could matter, but the movie makes no attempt to give some importance to this statement, they share some scenes, the talk about about each other, they fight, but nothing really comes out of it. It's the same with every single plot point you can think of. The Villain? Well, he's pale blue and angry and he has this massive spaceship fortress and wants to rule/destroy (not sure) the universe, but wait it turns out he's not the main villain, there's another guy and he's even...yeah a 12 year old might buy into this being legit character development, but I've grown far too old and cynical.In the end, "Guardians Of The Galaxy" feels like it starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. A very empty, yet confusing (albeit visually spectacular) experience. But all the glitter in the world can't make this shine. Sorry. ... are either ...1. getting bribed by the producers 2. friends or relatives of the producers 3. incredibly gullible and without any real points of reference as to what constitutes a good movie.The current IMDb of 8.1 is a huge insult to every great film out there.SPOILER: This film, with it's flat lifeless acting, non-plot, and terrible childish 'humour' will SPOIL YOUR BRAIN CELLS.DO NOT WATCH ... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!P.S. this is a gratuitous line of text to enable me to reach the IMDb required 10 lines....... oh dear, looks like I need to add a few more gratuitous words because I still haven't driveled on enough..... are we there yet?okay ... we're done here! Man oh Man, this movie was terrible, how this got an 8.6 is beyond me, and in fact that's what I went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies Hollywood pumps out.There is nothing to this movie, I went with a friend and I literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over. Its just an empty movie, all action with no story nothing, just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes.All recent movies like this including the new Amazing Spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them, Hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why I refuse to pay for movies in theatres. This movie just sucked. It was so damn juvenile that, as an adult, I felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school. There's a main underlying premise, but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end, and the damn thing is about 2 hours long. Chris Pratt's character was a rip-off Han Solo but extremely laid-back to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche, bro-surfer attitude, Zoe Saldana's character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part, and that damn raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper was more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars! This movie rips off Star Wars in many way, down to the retro-like scifi look of the movie. Half, and I mean it seemed like half...it was that boring, the movie took place in a prison, and nothing really happened besides their dumb escape...trust me it was stupid how they escaped. This movie is like watching an incoherent child's illogical dream. It is an orgy of impossible, child-like fantasy. There is nothing in it that made sense, and there is nothing that engaged the viewer. The antagonist is invincible, but wait no he's not...the protagonist is a fragile human, but wait no he's not...It's probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history. Hell, or it's probably one of the best! Marvel comic books are pathetically stupid, anyway. I hate this movie with a passion, and I so regret seeing it. Do yourself a favor and skip this boring, extremely poorly written film. There are people out there who can write a half decent script, and don't get the opportunity to ever have it heard. There are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen. There are sci-fi movies that have an original story that don't have a budget to be released at their full potential. Support people with talent and original ideas. Do not see Guardians of the Galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things. Congratulations on nailing the CGI though guys, that was great. If I felt like staring at great CGI for two and a half hours though, I'd play Call Of Duty. Disappointing would be a massive understatement for this turkey. Chris Pratt falls flat in his attempt at movie stardom. It takes more than hiring a personal trainer to be an A-lister & this guy lacks the "It Factor". The lame one liner jokes are relentlessly fired off, all of which fail to hit the mark. The CGI is heavy handed and distracting, this film is the cinematic equivalent of Kim Kardashian: desperate for attention, and utterly empty on the inside. Setting this epic lack of substance to the hits of yesteryear only highlights how desperate the Marvel hacks are to conjure up some sort of hipster factor. Sadly, Zoe Saldana (in green face) is wasted as the token female character in this excruciating hot dog fest. This "movie" will only satisfy the most simplistic of audience members: those who mistake product placement for entertainment. If all you are seeking is an empty shell of film featuring a truck load of hideous special effects, you will no doubt be pleased. okay guys i gave this movie the lowest score possible. for good reason.so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise. some horrible American actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date . her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west. let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters. a tree a raccoon and a meat head. who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt. the acting is crap. the story line is so obvious, within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome. As for the title "guardians of the galaxy" i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight. they only save one planet. sort of.i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didn't waste a cent. i would like to say a big EFF you to whomever picked the cast. to this point marvel has had amazing casts. iron man, Thor , captain America? this movie taints marvel. in their pursuit of profit. they have created another flopDO NOT BOTHER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Yeah, go and believe all the user reviews for this movie, and go the theater and waste the price of admission, whatever it is. Or, give me the benefit of the doubt, and trust what I am saying when I tell you that this movie stinks to high heaven. The CGI is top notch, but it ends there, and CGI by itself does not a movie make. There has to be a story, and this movie does not have any semblance of a story, at least not one that anyone could possibly follow or make any sense of, or one that, if published as a book, any sane and intelligent person would ever bother to read. The story told by a movie has to be good enough such that, if published as a book, it would be entertaining enough that people would bother to read it. This movie is nonstop action and fighting. In order to tell a story, it has to slow down a little here and there, but this movie never slows down at all. There is an orb, everyone wants it, and everyone fights over it. This really is all that there is to the story. I hated it so much that I wanted to walk out, but stayed, thinking that eventually it would have to get better, but it never did. This movie must have cost a lot to make, but the money they spent, however much it was, was spent manufacturing compost. I've NEVER written a movie review. After seeing the 8+ ratings on IMDb(whom I used to trust), I thought I'd take a chance, even though I'd seen the corny trailer on TV. It fit the time slot I needed and IMDb was 8+, how could this be bad, I thought!Spoiler alert, well, after the first scene in which the kids mom dies, which I thought at that point the movie had a chance, my hopes were dashed within the next few minutes and I knew that the next two hours were going to be pure agony and I was right. I was wondering if some of the glowing reviews were from people that had a stake in the movies success.Very poor story line, the aliens were all human like with subtle variances and it seemed to just drag on with predictable action and outcomes. There is really nothing I can say that is remotely good about the movie. The trailer looked incredibly stupid but I went anyway for the positive reviews. For the duration I couldn't shake the fact that everything I was seeing I had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer. GOTG lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s (from which it took most of the scenes). Mid showing I walked out to make a phone call. I almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story, character, wit, or creativity that the first half utterly lacked. Fortunately I saw it alone so I didn't have to deal with the social pressure to stay. If you see this, then I would recommend the early matinée discount. As the movie started I was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes. I thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some non-serious music started to play, the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there. After that there was special effect after special effect. I love special effects, but it did sound like this movie was made "only" to showcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and did I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed magnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye candy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by everyone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise, surprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's time. I loved the Ghost Rider, Thor, and the Amazing Spider-Man 2. Even The Avengers was tolerable, but this one was simply a mess. Designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie (Men in Black anyone?). One of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great, the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant. Remember how Thor had great colors in each and every scene? The colors actually went with one another. You don't see that here. A combination of light blue, orange, brown, grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene. It was a huge letdown. Next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art. In summary, this movie is not for adults. Take your kids to see it though. They will definitely love it, but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable, They'd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where it's really needed. Fighting Ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money. GUARDIANS OF THE CRAPLAXY It's been a while since I gave a comment about movies. Usually when I do, it's because the movie was extremely awesome or annoyingly full of cow dung. I went into the theater without any idea what guardian of the galaxy had in store. Sometimes a movie is more enjoyable when u don't know any synopsis at all. So that is what I did. All I knew was that it had a good number of positive reviews and IMDb had given it at least an 8. Most of the time when IMDb reviewers give a movie an 8 u know the movie is gonna be awesome.and nothing can or could go wrong. RIGHT????  HOW WRONG, I MEAN HOW VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY WRONG I WAS. Please if u r someone with a functioning brain I implore you not to go watch this garbage. Allow me to be the messiah when it comes to this movie. Take it that I have gone to sacrifice my cash and time for u to stay away and just download it if u can.and even that make sure u download it from a place that is sharing free Wi-Fi. Why do u ax? Why am I blasting this movie with so much ammo you ax? It's simple. Nowhere, ie weather in reality or fiction can a bunch of people always save a complex situation without coming out unscathed. Also I don't even know if the movie is a comedy or a thriller or action. It tries woefully to emulate all 3 to no success. I AM GONNA END HERE or I will go on and on. And I am trying hard not to give away spoilers. BUT LET NO ONE SAY I NEVER WARNED THEM. Ps: there are 2 sure fire ways to watch it without having any regrets. 1. Going to watch it with a lady friend that you wanna score, and 2. When you are high on weed. These 2 ways I guarantee will make you enjoy the movie so much more. I saw the rating of 8.3 at the IMDb and wanted to watch the movie. The movie started well but then it moved into the same lame side of the universe.The movie brings nothing new to us. It was like watching Avengers again(or any other superhero movie) where the superheroes fight with each other at the beginning but then unite to fight a common enemy. The movie was packed with inappropriate and lame humour. The acting was below average. Marvels should really consider the type of movies that they r making. I am still shocked that how on earth that this movie got an 8.3 ratings. This surely effects the CREDIBILITY of IMDb. Every human is so one dimensional and implausible that I can't even begin to understand the nature of this film. Where did eco-terrorist Alan Jonah go to? He took the Ghidorah skull from the last movie and then suddenly someone else gets it? Why is Dr Mark Russel even in this film? He does literally nothing in three different parts of the planet. Why does Ilene Andrews call after Jia when she runs off? She's DEAF! Why is Maya Simmons in this movie? She's the disposable daughter of the mad genius who displays no talent at all and dies off camera.Let's ignore the sheer human deaths in the thousands in every major act. Yet in every film to date, these awful parents allow their children to interact with titans. Usually when it's raining. Let's forget that children are able to walk inside not one, not two, but three highly sophisticated and guarded locations without interference. Plus they hitch a ride into some kind of mag-lev container which is transporting eggs we never hear about again and has a display in MPH even though it's an Hong Kong craft. The only thing this film does better than Godzilla: King of the monsters is there's fewer scenes with rain. But there's still a ton of rain. Why? I don't know.Why did they need Kong to "lead" them into hollow earth. They already had a reinforced cave leading to it. Kong didn't do anything except fall through a wormhole unscathed. While the humans needed three anti-gravity spaceships to travel there. And of course the debunked defamed author Nathan Lind is somehow also a pilot who once safely back home decides to stay airborne to watch the Titans battle it out instead of getting far away like a sane person might do. And this magical author/pilot found the single switch on the control panel which turns it into an ape defibrillator. And sure, chain up a titan on a transport boat but let's rig up a single lever to let him go. Hey, here's an idea, let's upload the essence of a dead hydra skull brain into a robot's energy source.Let's talk about how every light source in the facilities, crafts and bases plus all the buildings are lit in neon trim like they looted the set of TRON:legacy. How come Apex needed this mysterious energy source from Hollow Earth and when they take a small sample, they only thing they needed was math to recreate it? Did you know all you need to interrupt a satellite uplink into an unguarded control room is a half flask of booze poured on the cooling fan? I didn't, but the randomly Australian comic relief did.There's hardly a hint of blood from either monster even though Godzilla rakes its claws deep into Kong's flesh multiple times and both are dragged face-first into glass and steel buildings. Kong is also a master axe-man who uses the blade as a tool, a key and a shield.I could go on and on about this film but I am exhausted. If only someone could fly a tiny spaceship into my chest and restart me. As a society we've now truly become a case of life imitating art. We're living in an Idiocracy. That's what Godzilla v Kong represents. Empty calories for the masses. No nutrients for the grey matter. You don't need brains to enjoy this movie. In fact it helps if you're zombies.Forget the most important aspect of a movie which is a plot. Who needs a plot when you've got hundreds of millions of dollars of CGI on the screen. All those zeros, ones and green screens convincing brain dead viewers that this kind of crap being pumped out by Warner Brothers and other studios is worth your time and money. Does anyone recall a time when movies were actually good? When the plot was actually worth following? Then again, who needs something as trivial as an engaging plot when you're got a giant ape and a giant lizard beating seven bells out of one another as you slurp down your Brawndo?So keep handing over your money to these clueless studios and they'll happily keep churning out crap like Godzilla v Kong for you to gorge on. Or you can vote with your feet and your wallets and ensure that studios up their game. That moviemaker create protagonists that you can root for, villains whose motivations you can understand, characters that you can empathise with, go on a journey with....Or you can choose not to in which case enjoy your Brawndo, and movie studios will continue to mutilate your thirst for mediocre CGI crapfests like Godzilla v Kong.Just remember, "It's got electrolytes!" Absolutely nothing about this makes sense. From the fact that the girl kind of had to start teaching sign language to Kong by the time she was 1 week old, to the hollow earth ridiculous theory of a guy that wrote a book nobody bought but suddenly caught the eye of a Mexican gazillionaire with Mexican accent but an Amrican name that took a couple of months to build the technology that must have taken at least 15 years to design, test, and build. Nothing makes any sense whatsoever. Yes, the special effects and sound might be good but nothing else does. I didn't like the movie.Leaving aside the special effects, the plot is terribly bad, far-fetched and very difficult for children to understand.Bring two parallel stories, 1 the stories of humans seeking conspiracies, and 2 the story of kong and Godzilla,
It is unnecessary, the parts of the conspiracy seekers could well be cut and the movie would still stand and even improve a lot.Why such a far-fetched argument?But my God, what the hell is the Hollow Earth?It is an abuse of science fiction to raise another Earth within the earth, with a different gravity etc etc, it is too much! Or are they very high?But why the hell are they going to the hollow earth? This movie is so unbelievably bad it's a joke. I only watched it because it's free on HBO Max, so thank heavens I didn't waste a single cent on this abomination disguised as a "film". Characters have no meaning or purpose besides the little girl. All of this happens just for some middle schoolers to spill a drink on a circuit board to defeat a robot godzilla? I could have come up with a better story/script in my sleep. Skip this cash-grab garbage. This is the clearest evidence of how Hollywood can destroy great movie icons. Unable to make a decent film about Godzilla, they decided to destroy the two great cinema monsters with the bonus that Mechagodzilla's fantastic robot is reduced to a cockscrew. If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I don't ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzilla's music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. It's the same. An aberration. On the other hand, the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable, worried, it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes? The humans who star in the plot are also unbearable. The boy, the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone, their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film, and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity, starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug, this crap, this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I don't know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldn't even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood, don't do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs, well-shot fights aren't worth everything behind and around them. If you want to watch a decent movie, just watch the ones made in Japan or Pacific Rim. A terrible movie from beginning to end, and this is why I don't go see movies in theaters anymore. All computerized graphics and that's about it. It actually gave a headache. Two thumbs down! Full of plot holes, poor character development, mambo jumbo technology (seriously, they emailed energy source!) and 30 minutes fight scene. There isn't anything good I can say about this movie. The plot was bad, the acting was bad, the directing was bad. Wanna see kong watch the first one. What the hell was that? The CGI was incredible but the "story" made no sense whatsoever. Would highly recommend... To someone I dislike. Can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my pathetic life for this garbage. Millions of dollars spent on effects that are simply loud and obnoxious. The story is NOT science fiction. It is meaningless technobabble. I like some actual SCIENCE with my science fiction. Grims fairy tales make more scientific sense. That really is just a lazy marketing ploy .King Kong movies are about adventure and discovery, Godzilla flicks are about gimmecky lizards with lazer beams attached to their heads - if you get my drift .Kong has never been a 'monster', Godzilla has never been anything but .This film is reducing the intricate Heart of Darkness nature of the better Kong movies to the mostly cheap B-movie style of the Godzilla offerings .Why can't there be both, the elaborate story telling of King Kong (2005) and even Skull Island, and the neon coloured world of Godzilla for the less demanding ?Mid level marketing execs meetings - that's why we can't have nice things . Movie i watch wish i wasnt,
actors in movie are generic, milly from stranger things is so anoying,
and that child who translate king kong,
chep cgi effecet, ending was disaster...nothing special., dont waste time. Withoubt doubt this has to be the worst Kong film ever made. The story-line was nonsense, the acting was just awful, and the "connection" between Kong and the lovely little deaf and mute girl was pure saccharine too sickly to stomach. Wow!!! I thought the premiere of WW 84 was a hit mess from movie hell... well hold my beer Diana, Godzilla and Kong are stepping up to the plate and we are bringing MechaGodzilla along for the ride!What a convoluted mess of a schizophrenic piece of boiling hot crap!My absolute favorite is the using of some fandangled hover craft anti gravity electromagnetic wanna be Tesla craft as a defribulator! Wow!!! Now that's creative script writing.Cant wait to see what crap Hollywood churns out next. I desperately try to give movies a chance. I even try to give campy movies some consideration in perspective. But this movie was tortuous. With so much material to work with...the writers seemed to not care at all about the audience and seemed to write two separate scripts then smash them together at the end. I had no idea what the point was for most of the movie...when it even tried to have one. To point out the vast absurdities in the film would almost bait you to watch it out of curiosity. My wife and 8 year old son both fell asleep because nothing made sense. You are going to watch it...it is the only new thing since COVID. But if this was a normal year of blockbusters this would not get a nod. How can you call the movie Godzilla vs Kong when there only like 30 minutes of fighting. There's an insane amount of characters for a monster movie. Plot sucks, strange attempts at comedy, and they still haven't explained how Godzilla stands in the middle of the ocean! Three little words. Just plain sucked. It seemed impossible to make a movie about two of the most famous creatures in movie history throwing down boring but by God they did it. Sitting through this lloooonnnngggg "movie" was about as much fun as getting a root canal. The only good part of the whole thing was the closing credits because the pain finally stopped. If you like movies with action, comedy, and fun, you better take a hard pass on G vs K. King Kong should've been dead by now. Why am I watching a nuclear lizard spend his time with a stupid ape. I hate this. Its just absolutely inane, preposterous, uninspired, OTT nonsense with its specious bare bones story just an excuse to have two CGI leviathans battle it out!Utter, utter crap imo! Such a waste of time, Don't even bother watching it. Tragedy that so much money was spent on such rubbish. And that it is expected that the public are to be charged to see it.Should be a vaccine against such viral garbage. Don't waste your time. The special effect were great but the acting was average at best, the plot nearly put me to sleep.And there was a bunch of stuff in the movie that made no sense... your watching it and thinking where did that come from or how did they come up with that. There is one great performance in this dreadful movie and that is from young Kaylee Hottle who deserves 10 stars. ... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.So, let's count off:Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: "Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all."Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed "I feel a little dizzy" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch "I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!" dialog? Check.Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour. i went in expecting a scary monster movie.what i got was 15 minutes of bad TV dialog, and 45 minutes of shaky-cam running through the streets. the acting was OK but the characters were really unpleasant. not only did i not care if they died, by the end of the movie i was rooting for the monster.there were a lot of plot holes and the decisions everyone made were totally unrealistic. it was hard to stay in the movie because of the constant lapses of common sense and logical flaws. those kinds of things really annoy me when they could have been fixed with a line or two of dialog.finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time. What on earth is this movie doing with a 8.1/10 rating?I think I'm being kind with a 3/10. It is just as a big a disaster for me as its trying to portray(but fails completely)Now what puzzles me is why on earth would you go completely calm and focused towards an alien monster trashing the city with bombs being dropped on it? O please..to save a women who should have been dead but miraculously survives. She has a metal rod through her chest (or i think it was, with all that nauseating camera work) and should have died of loose of blood.... Now another thing i don't quite get is the camera...hmmm 10 hours of battery..yea, Captures all the good bits of an exiting adventure,HD quality and doesn't run out of battery or stop working from all the times its dropped and thrown in the movie! God i have to find a place where they sell these!And now onto the acting...acting? Its not hard to scream and look really scared which is all they do..they don't even need to look convincing because half the time the camera is trying to look really really realistic and is filming the ground. Now this guys best friend that is filming...i don't think i have come across a narrator that annoying. What does he do in the movie apart from saying..omg what just happened dude?..what was that?Dude this is scary. I mean what the ****?When he finally dies after miraculously surviving a helicopter crash with his friends i rejoiced! Sorry for not knowing his name but even now i don't even know who's who?Just don't bother with this movie, please I'm glad i only downloaded it first before going out to watch in the cinemas. You'll be wishing the movie to end so you can get on with your life. I will admit, the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean, I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However, it's hard to have this curiosity, no matter how intriguing the monster is, when the script is so tired its in a coma.Yes, the monster is cool. No, the stupid hand-held camera gimmick didn't bother me. Yes, the special effects are great and at times I did find myself in awe of the spectacle on the screen as it does seem real, but the movie itself is so, so, so dumb. At any moment I felt comfortable to leave to use the restroom as I knew exactly what I was going to miss. The plot was a paint by numbers and I would have loved even a touch of Bob Ross to fill the blanks, but no originality whatsoever.First they steal the overdone Hollywood bit about love. "Dude, if you love her, tell her." Response: "I can't tell her, unless a mutant alien/ocean creature tries to expunge the city, only then will I try and make my move." Why have this? Why not make the story the monster? Really, who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found, which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.Second, they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. "Let's try night vision on the camera." And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons, ones we can't see coming (which is why I think those monsters were blind). Cloverfield does none of this. It's a, where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie, he's not funny, just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV, but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was "That's terrible" when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by, "That's terrible too" when we see when of its young-lings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie, words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter, "That's terrible cubed" before he was engorged upon. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Fourth, we have the killer/villain/monster has one last leap. Yes, we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. "We killed him" Hud proclaims, just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary, why? Oh, it's not scary, and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. Fifth, they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever, because King should always have chapters taken out, and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise, they may actually need to give the characters some arc, have some purposeful shots of the monster, maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and, uh-oh, give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did, I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it, as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing, but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good, but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful, but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T-2, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant film-making. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there, I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over, I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny, which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook, trite, clichéd, not smart, overdone, not scary, bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2, but pretty darn close. I have to hand it to JJ Abrams....we fell for this flick hook line and sinker.The only downside is it COMPLETELY lacked substance. There was NO story. We went to see a monster movie only to find out NOTHING...I mean NOTHING about it. It was about stupid people who were unwilling to leave the city...and then were killed. Big deal.In the end you didn't know how the monster got there, if they actually killed it, what it's powers were, what the little monsters were, where it came from, what it wanted....you never even got to see the entire shape of it or the use of all it's body parts.It is the only movie I have ever wanted to walk out of. I just kept waiting for it to get better.If Abrams ends Lost this way the world is going to come unglued!!!!! Well, I clicked spoiler, but the spoiler is that there are no spoilers. Nothing to the movie.About 75% of the audience hung around through the end credits, and let me tell you, that was universally the most negative reaction I have ever seen to any movie in a theater.Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe how these people felt (at least according to how they expressed themselves).The movie is, fortunately, short; only 90 mins or so long. 20 mins of that is spent at a party you would leave after 10 minutes if you hadn't paid to get in--a going away party for some loser that looks like a guy from your company's mail room. Apparently this loser has been promoted (improbably) to be a VP for his company in Japan.The party apparently is intended to set up whatever is supposed to pass for the movie's paper thin plot line. All it did for me was condition me to the intentionally awful camera-work. Yeah, I realize it is stylistic and all---but bad camera-work doesn't pass for action. No, running through a crowd jostling a camera around does not translate to movie magic on screen.There will be internet fan boys that will tell you the movie is great, a must see, very intense. Whatever. They are deluding themselves. These people will have spent the last year or more pumping this movie for JJ Abrams and will be unable to admit to themselves or you that it is simply not good. Hey, have ten bucks and two hours of your life to blow? Why not try Cloverfield! If you like motion-sickness inducing, hand-held, close-up, can't-focus-on-anything movies (a.k.a., anything by Michael Bay) then this is a movie for you and your six second attention span! Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there. In the meantime all of the monster crap interrupts a very special episode of Dawson's Creek, you know, the one where Dawson's going to leave for Japan and he finds out at the party that Joey's been sleeping around on him? Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.But hey, on the bright side, everyone died and that made me smile.It's a big-budget C-movie, and while that may sound like something entertaining to fans of shlock films, trust me when I tell you that it's not. Give me Godzilla vs. Mothra any day over this steaming pile. At least those movies have heart. I am more of a "vote and not post" person but I have to at least get the word out that this movie is terrible!! People just need to AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS . . . . not your wallet costs!! 20 minutes of Blair Witch type camera-work for a going-away-party. The rest with unsteady camera shots that totally gave me a migraine headache. Horrible!! Storyline was poor and VERY slow. I kept finding moments to just close my eyes and try to make the agony stop. The ending was one of those where you look at your movie companion(s) and say, "ummm, is that it??? oh wait, there has to be more" and you sit and sit and realize that it's over. My friend and I agree that it is a mix of Blair Witch meets Starship Troopers meets Aliens. What a waste of time and money. This movie would have been good if the camera was put down and a film was made. When the attack began the director should have the camera dropped then pan out and the movie start. Film the characters running and trying to rescue their friend. But, the way the movie was videotaped made the footage jerky and nauseating to watch. The fighting between the army and the "monster" was good, but again left you with too many unanswered questions. Besides, when a rescue helicopter takes off they do not fly parallel to the danger, they would fly away from danger. The ending was empty and left the viewers full of questions. Nothing was ever explained. Just stay at home and watch some home movies taped by your three year old. Might make more sense. I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film, I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.I didn't like this clichéd film. I believe it is a flawed exercise about character perspective and documented realism. However, the special effects were poor but some of them passable; the editing kept an appropriate rhythm; the performances were regular, with the clear exception of T.J. Miller who played the obnoxious camera man, Hud. He did an awful job.My main dislikes with this film were the camera movement and the argument overall.First, the camera moves excessively all time. Even during the party sequence, all the scenes are horribly captured. Hud wasn't running from a monster then, was he? I get the filmmaker's intention, but I felt more nauseated than afraid because they went too far with their movement. The moment I dissociated myself from the movie and started feeling trapped inside a really expensive handy-cam, I knew the original intention had gotten lost. In that respect, the Blair Witch Project (which I also didn't like, but for other reasons) is superior by far. Its technical proposal does help convey a profound emotional impact; whereas Cloverfield's camera trembling doesn't. Consequently, the characters on Cloverfield remain mostly aloof, which really makes some silly elements in the plot to stand out.SPOILERS START NOW: That brings me to my second main dislike: the argument. Were they joking? I don't even mean the monster. It's a monster movie, so I won't even go there. Everyone goes to save Beth, the romantic interest of Rob, who is beyond logical salvation. Sure, Rob's friends try to stop him from going to his certain death, but they all end up joining him anyway (!) Consequently, "Beth" becomes more of a cheap plot device than a character.But I mean Marlena joined them? From what we know of her, she wouldn't. That's character inconsistency right there. So, let's assume she had her psychological reasons to do it. She's after all supposedly human and complex. But throughout her time on the screen nothing happens to shed any light as to why she is with them. So, there's no depth to her. No need for her, expect to save Hud's life once.Also, the love story between Rob and Beth rests so much in what some people say of them and a few lines between the wretched lovers, that it becomes shallow and boring. Sure, some say he's been in love with her forever and they do share a wonderful day at Columbus Circle and Coney Island. Of course, she has got to be the love of his life. I'm not cynical, and I actually enjoy romantic themes, but this was an insult. I mean, the whole story rests so much on this supposed doomed love that it ought to have been better explored. The performances were so flat in this category, that they didn't help either. Again, the love story turned into yet another sort of plot device.When the friends "rescue" Beth from her building, she is severely injured, and yet she can walk and even run. At the end, when they arrive to the evacuation area, despite her bleeding injury, Beth is not the first one to climb into the helicopter. In fact, she has to wait for another helicopter to take her out because the soldiers offer the only seat to Lily, who is physically well. It is ridiculous. Obviously, the real reason the filmmakers did that is so that the lovers, Rob and Beth, could remain together until the end. Have I said plot device before? Cheap and trashy plot device? And there's more, much more rubbish like that throughout the film. SPOILERS HAVE ENDED. Also, the fact that Hud was filming everything -even in the party- almost every private moment, is ludicrous. The filmmaker's choice of the handy-cam as the true narrator is too limited, so he naturally had to use it to an unbelievable degree. The consequence is that the purpose of capturing a sense of realism is defeated, and Cloverfield ends up being an absurdly unrealistic movie in its own monster-destroying-New-York-movie context-.In Cloverfield, the filmmakers ask you to accept too many things just as they tell you they are. However, the movie consistently fails to provide you with valid reasons for doing so. They keep forcing on you a story of the poorest quality. It's almost offensive.Weak screenplays do that. And when they do, one at least expects something in return, whether a feeling or a memorable moment. Something that would justify the torture. Unfortunately, with Cloverfield one ends up empty-handed, jerky camera movements aside.I don't recommend this film at all, especially if you value the use of a tripod or the meaning of storytelling. In any case, if you're going to see it, please don't expect anything great and try not to eat or drink liquids for a couple of hours before and while watching it. In all honesty, it can make you feel physically (as well as mentally) nauseated. This has got to be the worst monster movie I have ever seen! Wait, not worst monster movie, worst MOVIE PERIOD! The whole movie is laughable. I sat there in the theater and wanted to know if and when anything was going to start. First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even starts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party guests and drunken camera wedding style say "hi" to Rob before he goes to Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you that they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip about 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of initial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens that keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses of it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big disappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even remotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body parts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three spots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They are used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting, and it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit longer. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship Troopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they just don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from Japan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the Japanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no Cloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the Godzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez called! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair Witch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home. I was very excited to see this movie when I entered the theater on Wednesday afternoon.I was very impressed with the trailers that were on the screen before the main show;"CLOVERFIELD". But as the movie started I felt I had entered a bad dream, one that I could not wake up from! As I sat there, in the first 10 Mins., my brother-in-law got so sick with all the "camera shake" that he had to leave the theater.The first 20mins. was so boring I almost got up to join him. The plot was so vague that I felt I had walked in in the middle of the movie. Now some people would say; Why did you stay and watch such a bad movie? Well, let me tell you , I am a great lover of movies and consider myself a movie expert,"self proclaimed Of course"and I will almost never walk out,but this movie came very close.The monster had no personality and was boring!And at the end it just stops.YES STOPS! with no explanation of anything...the people...the monster....the city....nothing! You might think,"Great there's going to be a Sequel" I say no way,I hope they make a bundle on this one cause- Fool me once shame on you but fool me twice shame on me and then shoot me in the head to put me out of my misery!Bottom line THIS MOVIE SUCKED! Thank you for reading this hopes this helps. There were two interesting things about seeing this movie, unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie, that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be, raw footage. The acting was lacking at best, the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot, which it *might* have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.But even the worst visual movies can have a deeper meaning, right? So what about this one? There are obvious 9/11 references/similarities, for instance, it was an attack on NYC. The imagery of terrified people running through the streets from the dust clouds of a collapsed building would conjure thoughts of 9/11 in even the most dim witted person. But as much as you pick this one apart there wasn't any purpose beyond using it as an implement to regurgitate fear. No, this movie isn't some sort of pompous social commentary on the American dream/lifestyle/people/whatever. It's actually quite empty as far as metaphor/meaning goes. But honestly, it's not like people would expect that from a monster movie anyway, right? Although it was the connection this movie shared with 9/11 that brings me to my first interesting point. Almost every time a tragedy of this proportion occurs there are countless stories (books, movies or any other medium) that reference it (however vaguely) for decades to come. For example, look at post-Nagasaki/Hiroshima Japan. I'd be curious to see the list of movies that depict the mass destruction of Tokyo via atomic or nuclear bomb. Not to mention the other Japanese movies that center around the general ruining of cities... mostly by a few specific gigantic monsters... which will remain unnamed. The second interesting thing happened to be something which I've never witnessed in a movie theater before. It made it worth paying the ten dollars for a ticket, wasting an hour and half of my life and enduring a headache the camera work gave me. As the ending credits started and the lights slowly came back on the audience unanimously started trash-talking the movie. There was booing from all corners of the theater, someone seated behind me said harshly "this movie sucked!", and the girl who was with him asked him, "what did you drag me to??" Their reactions were fairly amusing, and undoubtedly the best part of the whole movie experience. All in all there were a couple of really cool visuals in the movie... Unfortunately this alone isn't worth the price of the movie, not even the price of the DVD, not even the price of the DVD once it goes into the "shitty $3.99 movie bin" at best buy. Either stay clear of this one or if your curiosity gets the best of you find a pirated version for free.::SPOILER:: Oh, and before I forget. For all the reported "realism" in this movie I'd like someone to explain to me exactly how a plastic video tape survives the tens of millions of degrees caused by the blast of a nuclear bomb......But now I'm just being nit picky. Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs. It appears that the writers had the idea of the Statue of Liberty having its head roll down a street and then struggled like crazy to pad the rest of the movie. Hence it is extremely short and extremely bad.The storyline that drives the characters within spitting distance of the monster at every opportunity is flimsy at best and to be honest, even though it is a movie about a monster terrorising a city it's the small things in it that make it most unbelievable. The fact that the guy talks the military into letting him risk his life (for a girl he slept with once by the way!), the exploding people, the fact that you can abuse a camera so badly and still have it work, the fact that you can buy a phone battery in a shop and not have to charge it before use, the convenient buildings propping each other up allowing for a daring rescue, the immense healing capabilities of the main characters who survive impalement and a crashing helicopter with barely a scratch, carrying the camera incessantly throughout this whole 'terrifying' ordeal, the stare out between monster and camera man at the end. I could go on but its making me feel ill thinking about this movie so much, so soon after seeing it.The fact that you can barely make out what is going on doesn't help either. I think it was meant to add grit and suspense to the film, only giving you fleeting glimpses of the monster, but in the end it just helps to tarnish this train wreck of a movie even further by making sure its a blurred mess.I left the cinema feeling cheated of my money. If it wasn't by J.J. Abrahms and the viral marketing didn't happen this film would have went largely unnoticed and would have been barely memorable. Its carrying mostly on the crest of Abrahms 'Lost' wave but anyone with a little bit of common sense and their rose tinted Lost spectacles removed can see how much of a weak movie this is.Avoid.  SPOILER ALL THE WAY Where do I start.....Awful Camera Work. Seriously, do I want to spend money to watch a movie that looks like a 10 year old with a handy cam filmed it? This gimmick needs to die with this movie. It simply doesn't work, not the way they filmed this moviewreck.Screen Play by Comic Book writer? Seriously, who wrote this script? Skyscrapers leaning on skyscrapers? Girl with two foot steel bar going through her chest has it pulled out and continues on her merry way through collapsed leaning building, down the standing building it is leaning on, across town, to the subway, to the conveniently stumbled upon Military Hospital and finally, the escape helicopter, that CRASHES, and ends up at THE bridge. Yup, great writing skills here. Very creative.What were those little alien bugs and where did they come from?? Who cares. YAWN!! Dum. What else can I add or say about them. There are millions of them the little critters but somehow, our heroes manage to get by fighting off 1 or 2. Yes, 1 or 2. Too bad only one of the heroes gets bit. Oh, well, maybe not too bad, because we did get to know that you EXPLODE if you get bit as a result. YAWN!!! Who cares? What does it matter?This monster is something. You can't kill it for love of technology or big bombs. I love the monster scene at the very end. The camera guy gets eaten, boohoo. It should have happened in the first 30 seconds. Oh, the camera and his head survive, well, bitten off. Nice shot of the head in the grass because the camera falls and... focuses on the head, the grass, the head, the grass.... YAWN. And, our number one, romantic, brave hero guy with the girl friend who has a hole in her chest and has not yet bleed to death has the where-with-all to.... pick up the camera and keeps on recording until the nuke drops. YAWN!!!OH, this is no ordinary handy-cam!! No sir.... Spot Lights for lighting up dark subway tunnels, NIGHT VISION to see nasty bugs that are about to fall off the ceiling in the dark subway tunnel, batteries that run on nuclear power and last forever constantly filming and doing all the high tech search light stuff etc etc. And, how many times does the putz who is carrying it drop it, trip, fall down stair ways etc..... damaged?? No sir. I WANT THIS CAMERA.Plot.... right: Hero Guy meets girl. Hero Guy sleeps with girl. Hero Guy loves girl but doesn't call because he is going overseas to a new job. Girl comes to going away party with other guy. Heartache, lets talk, lets fight, lets eaves drop..... YAWN.Monster interrupts 20 something angst-party. Monster rips up city. Too bad it didn't eat everyone at the party. Well, he does. One at a time.Hero guy and party pals run and misplace some friends. Hey, it can happen.Hero guy NOW calls girl. (look, she gets misplaced and there is a lot going on! Don't ask me how, but it all happens in this handy cam fiesta.) But, he doesn't have a nuclear battery, like the one in the handy cam so before he calls, he has to go to an electronics store to steal a nuclear battery. Yessir!Where did the Girl go?? Girl went home to ground zero so she could be impaled by steel bar in half fallen, leaning skyscraper. Yes, she leaves the party during the Monster scene and goes back to her apartment in the confusion on the other side of town. Yes, the side with the monster. Come on, stay with the story line here!!Ring, Ring: HelloHero Guy: I love youGirl: oooooooh, I'm stuck under a building with a steel bar through my chest! I am faint and the line will go dead.... Now.Hero Guy: I'll save you. I love you. YAWN FEST.Hero guy drags all party friends to ground zero to remove girl from steel bar. Hey, it has to be done.They leave. What is a movie in New York without a subway scene. What is a movie in New York without monster buggy things in the subway scene. What is a Hollywood Gawd-Awful movie without a convenient chance arrival to a hospital. A party girl explodes due to monster-offspring-creepy-crawly bite while walking in subway. Hero guy and girlfriend with big bleeding hole-in-chest (but lots of blood to bleed) try to leave. Monster interrupts departure. Monster leaps up and grabs the escape helicopter. I saw it coming it was sooo obvious.Monster eats the camera guy. Best part of the movie because you hope your visual pain is over and you can now leave..... Nope. The Hero-Guy and Love Girl with still bleeding gaping hole in chest from big steel bar make it to a Bridge.Nuke drops. The End. The End. Really. Fade to Black. The movie just stops. Dead. Finished. 80 minutes or so.... OVER. Credits, leave the theater.You shake your head and wonder what the heck did you just waste your time paying to see.Save your money. This film needs to be bitten and chewed up and hope it explodes into the trash bin of moviewreck history. There will be a sequel, count on it. It will be as bad or worse.OH, I asked for my money back when I left the theater. Yes, I asked for my money back. Total and complete waste of time. After seeing the viral campaign with extremely well done fake news footage I had high hopes for this movie. I've always been a lover of the monster movie/horror genre...hell I even sort of enjoyed the Godzilla remake despite it's many failings and strong smell of cheese but Cloverfield? well what can I say...I went into watching this film knowing it was filmed entirely in a shaky "Blair Witch" cam style,but I didn't expect over an hour of motion sickness overkill.Unless you have taken the time to watch ALL of the viral marketing the first 20 minutes of the film are a COMPLETE waste of time.Don't get me wrong I don't expect any film like this to slap you in the face from minute 1 with monster attacks and carnage but the first 20 minutes would have made much more sense to those going in totally fresh if they would have spliced in some of the back story.Namely the reasons behind the career move and the company he was going to work for,the attack on the oil rig and possibly a teaser news clip before going into the final few minutes of the party and then the attack.I understand the idea behind having "amateur footage" but the film tries WAY to hard to get that idea over.Seriously I knew full well that it was supposed to be a handy cam after 5 minutes,they didn't need to vaguely wave the camera around every few minutes to get the point across.Yes this film has been compared to Blair Witch but Blair Witch had something that Cloverfield SERIOUSLY lacks...Ambiance.In Blair Witch even though you never see anything the off camera sounds give the film the mood it needs to drive the story and give the feeling of fear.Cloverfield simply doesn't have that and it leaves me feeling no compassion for the characters and no sense of danger unless they are in the open and within shouting distance of the monster(s) Simply put this movie is a love or hate experience,there isn't any middle ground.Although it's meant for the big screen I'd advise waiting till it's available for rent to avoid disappointment If you like screaming through the whole movie and a home movie effect where the camera holder is totally useless and cant stay upright or in perspective you MAY like this. Besides strobe like effects and completely ridiculous situations, ie: helicopter falls from 39 stories+ and only the 3 heroes survive, a 39 story building leaning on its opposite counterpart and the hero climbing stairs, crossing the roof, removing his live girlfriend from reo stuck through her chest and climbing down again while video is swaying to and fro? STUPID. Good effects if you can follow them and not a bad monster. Put me off the director for good I think. And I am a sci-fi nut. And what is "Cloverfield"? This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The camera was all shaky for most of the movie. The movie did not have a story line. The monster is destroying their city but it doesn't show why the monster is doing it or where the monster is from and how it got there without anyone noticing. I honestly don't know how anyone could like this movie it was GARBAGE. None of the movie was good. There was not even one good scene. I don't know how someone could make a movie that is so bad. All I can say is that seeing this movie is a waste of time and money. I was so mad during the whole movie. The monster was not even scary!! I don't recommend this movie to anyone!! I don't know why the director would even think about making a sequel because this movie was a waste of film. I don't even want to give this movie a one out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a ZERO out of ten ..it is way in the negatives. I never comment on movies, but this was just horrific. Not only does the filming make you sick to your stomach, but the actual movie was bad. They never explain what the monster is or how it came to be, they don't let you know what happens to the characters, nor do they give any follow up on anything. Horrible. People left the theaters so angry that they paid to see this piece of garbage, myself included. I'm so angry. I sat through the entire movie with my head in my hands because of the shaking camera, and besides that, the movie had no conclusion. It literally just ends. I am extremely disappointed and I feel cheated that I even invested $11.25 and almost 2 hours of my time. I saw this movie with my friends yesterday and I was so disappointed with it. First of all I had very low expectations of the movie because I had read forums about the movie thus knowing what to expect. Too bad the forums I was on had so many fan boys/girls that their views were somewhat tainted. Thus I know beforehand that the movie: (A) is a monster movie (B) it was shot through first person POV (C) it was about a group of young people's battle for survival.But I never expected the movie to lack a cohesive plot, empathetic characters and a good ending. I mean who in their right minds would rescue someone knowing that a monster is running amok trying to devour them all. OK, I understood Rob's reason a little bit (but it still is moronic) because he was in love. What was Lilly, Hud and that other girl's reason? I just don't get it. These characters defy the very rule of human nature: that is the need for self preservation.The movie also had a lot of loopholes. Some of them include a camcorder with an unlimited battery life, a person who is still filming even though they are in danger, and a girl who survives (and can very much run around) after being struck by a rod in the torso (?).I went inside the movie theater expecting at least some thrills here and there, but all I got was a lingering headache. All in all I hate hate hate this movie. Seeing how many trailers ran for this before it's release I was already worried this film was going to be truly awful. Anything getting hyped that much normally is awful. The film is all shot on hand-held cameras which is an incredibly bad idea. If Blair Witch taught us anything, it was hand-held cameras in a movie look abysmal! And this movie is no different.It's incredibly slow to get started, with no action until your 20 minutes into the film & that's where they jump the shark. If your in a building & just experienced an earthquake then on a roof to see an explosion & running downstairs from falling fireballs the VERY last thing your going to do is carry on filming at eye-level from a hand-held camera. Your either going to drop it or lower it down to waist height to allow yourself to run faster.And thats the kind of basic rookie mistake that ruins films. The bad hand-held camera work was already doing that anyway but a stupid goof like that killed the film before it ever got started. The people photographing the head of The Statue Of Liberty are just WAY too calm. There would be absolute hysteria, people would be going mental! As far all the destroyed buildings & falling rubble? In a post 9/11 climate is a movie with these images really a good idea or just incredibly stupid. The latter I feel.Rob getting a call from Beth on his cell phone? Highly unlikely after that kind of city devastation, lines would be restricted to emergency calls only. The scene on The Brooklyn Bridge is not believable at all. No-one seems frightened. Even when the bridge collapses the camera guy turns around to film whats happening. No-one would do that, you'd be too busy running away or getting trampled in the panic.When we finally do see bits of the monster it's an incredibly cheap looking effect. Even 1970's Dr Who would have been embarrassed about that thing. It looked like it cost all of $10, if that. A very cheap rubbery monster. A cheap Godzilla rip-off.Rob's motivation for rescuing Beth is zero. They had a huge argument at the party and he was upset when she left. His mood towards her suddenly changing is incredibly suspect & a very POOR plot device. The soldiers they encountered, not 1 said get down (before they started firing), not 1 said turn back. It just wouldn't happen. The plausibility of the movie just gets less & less by the scene.You also have to question Hud not knocking Rob out by the time their in the subway. Even truly good friends would have punched his lights out by then. As for "walking the tunnels"? If there's a light on the camera, why isn't Hud walking at the front so everyone behind him can see? As far as them being attacked by those creatures? The movie should have ended right there because they were outnumbered & should have all been killed.The way they just suddenly meet the soldiers is far too simple. Marlena dies (even though you never see anything, she's bleeding from her eyes then is taken behind a curtain where you see an explosion of blood so its safe to assume she's VERY dead).With Rob saying to the soldier "If you want to stop me you'll have to shoot me", the soldier should have pulled out his gun and done us ALL a favour. Even after seeing Beth's building half knocked down Rob STILL thinks she's alive? I'm sorry but 1 of the 2 remaining friends would have actually knocked him out cold at that point.After pulling Beth off the spike, why wasn't she bleeding like crazy? Also the awful & incredibly predictable scare when the monster hits the helicopter? And they survive the crash? I think at this point in the movie they had run out of ideas & were just doing anything to kill time.Hud gets an excellent death (bitten in half by the monster) & then you get Rob & Beth talking to the camera, an explosion, rubble falling, Coney Island then nothing. No ending, no resolution? And to those who think they saw a splash in the sea at the end? It's a ship sailing from left to right, certainly nothing splashing into the sea like so many claims I've read. What an awful film. From start to lack of finish, utter garbage! Not recommended to anyone, ever. I assume that the target market for this movie is people who missed Blaire Witch, all 20+ Godzilla movie, and who have not yet gotten enough of the images of the 911 tragedy. For those viewers this may seem like a fresh and exciting experience. For the rest of us it is an utter failure of creativity and film making.I was advised to state that my comments on Cloverfield amount to a spoiler. So... Warning : spoiler. But I actually question if there is a spoiler to this film. I personally think in retrospect of having seen the movie, that the trailer is completely honest. The only thing hidden in the trailer is the exact shape of the "entity" that beheads the statue of liberty. What the heck is"Cloverfield"? It's simple "Cloverfield" is a terrible movie.Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. This is a cheap rip off film which can be best summarized as "blaire witch" meets "godzilla" and with an overdose of post-911 fear thrown in. Why induce 911 references and play of that remaining fear? Because this movie is so lame that it needs cheap references to 911 to get any excitement going what so ever. The only good thing you can say is that it is short - only 80 minutes long. But even at 80 minutes it is way too long. I found myself yawning with boredom. No amount of special effects or jerky camera work can save this snoozer.But a boring horror/scifi film might just end up being simply bad or average. Not Cloverfield. The thing that raises Cloverfield to the status of terrible movie is that it is so incredibly, completely, utterly unoriginal. Blaire Witch was not a great film - it was however original and creative - if annoying and slightly nauseating due to jerky camera action. It used low budget techniques to tell a scary story. Like it or not there was creative thought and originality in that film. It made the most of low tech.In 1954 Ichiro Honda's Gojira, ゴジラ (Godzilla for the US release), was a ground breaking film that inspired an entire genre of films, spoke to the horrors of the atomic age, decried the racist occupation of Japan, and honestly foreshadowed the horrors of the 911 attacks. Filmed on shoe string budget in post war Japan, Gojira in it's original uncut 90 minute release was a remarkable and chilling film. Honda used low tech effects to create moving and terrifying cautionary tale of retribution for the horrors of nuclear war. Though modern audiences now jaded by overwhelming overused special effects may have difficulty connecting with the special effects of 1954, Gojira still stands up, and still sends a chill down the spine. The opening credits, from a completely black screen bold white characters burst forth with the awesome roar of Gojira and the rumble of giant foot steps. In 2008 that roar and those foot steps assaulting the silence of the theatre still inspire real fear. One can only imagine the effect on audiences of 1954.What does Cloverfield inspire? Boredom and nausea. Nausea not born of anxiety - but rather motion sickness from jerky camera work. Warning! This movie will make you motion sick! So a movie that is completely unoriginal. A movie that shamelessly steals it premise from two well known movies. That's pretty terrible. Add to that the fact that the main characters are undeveloped, unlikable, and incredibly stupid, and you have a stunningly bad movie.Since I have a personal interest in movies about giant monsters who flatten cities I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing something original. Such a premise offers the possibility of a mystery or a surprise... or some clever twist that would pay tribute to the original - the great Gojira. An homage? I mean it seemed so obvious that there was some unknown monster out there tearing up the city - so obvious that no one in their right mind could simply leave it at that - especially after all the hype. Maybe Gojira would show up. There had to be more right? Right? Wrong. I guess all the remakes - Godzilla vs Rodan, vs, Mothra, vs Monster X, All monsters must Die, Godzilla 2000 - just slipped the minds of the producers - is that it? No this movie is exactly what it is - there is no surprise. Giant monster attacks New York. Buildings crash into clouds of dust that leave New Yorkers coughing and staggering about the post apocalyptic streets were they get eaten. (Oh yeah - plan on seeing a reference to two other famous horror films - "Alien" and "The Thing") Sheets of office paper flutter through the sky a la 911 footage. Cloverfield is a completely predictable and entirely derivative film that is driven by a highly choreographed well executed marketing campaign - that's all. I went to see Cloverfield with very high expectations; the trailers had got my attention, and I enjoyed "Lost" which had the same writer. I was expecting something that was fresh, original, with a decent storyline and quality dialog.Unfortunately, this film was a huge disappointment; it offered none of the above. The story is told from the viewpoint of one of the characters that has a hand-held camcorder, and as a consequence the pictorial style of the movie is very similar to "Blair Witch", e.g. jerky camera shots in an attempt to make the film more "realistic". Unfortunately, this becomes extremely annoying after 15 minutes or so, and as a ploy to make the audience think they watching an amateur recording it is totally destroyed by the incredible sound quality, supposedly from the same source.In addition, there isn't a storyline as such; some people are having a party, and a destructive creature suddenly appears and trashes the city they are in. There is no explanation of where the creature came from, or what it is. It's a pure lift from any Godzilla movie. The rest of the movie is simply watching the jerky camcorder follow the characters (albeit with incredible sound quality) through the city as first they try to escape, and then have to turn back to find the true love of one of the characters. Yes, it really *is* that clichéd.After that, the storyline (what is left of it) gets steadily more and more ridiculous. The characters go into a subway and are attacked by face hugger outtakes from "Aliens". The army take them into custody, but instead of evacuating them they let them go because - hey! - the male lead is going back to find his true love. So much for realism ;) The girl they're looking for is trapped in a tower block that has been attacked by the alien, and which is collapsing, but which has conveniently not fallen over completely but just come to lean against another tower block... the same as you see in any war zone - NOT. When they climb the tower to find the girl, she is pinned down by a steel rod through her shoulder. However, they pull her free, and despite the resultant blood loss she is soon running around the city like a spring chicken trying to escape. Again, so much for realism ;) The key fault with Cloverfield is that is it an unholy marriage of two totally conflicting styles; the realistic, camcorder style of "Blair Witch" that records the relationship between the characters, and the desire to use that same style to give some indication of the enormity of the alien that is destroying the city. It simply doesn't work, specially when it is hampered by a script that becomes more and more implausible by the minute.Cloverfield has no outstanding dialog, no character development, no plausible plot line, and no sense of realism. The special effects are reasonable, but they weren't what I came to see. It really is that bad, and I wasn't the only one to think so. At the end of showing I went to, there was a stunned silence, and then people started laughing... in disbelief that they'd sat and watched such a pile of rubbish.This is easily a candidate for the worst film of 2008. Cloverfield is the type of film that asks so much from its audience and delivers so little. Right from the start it basically gets down on its hands and knees begging and pleading everyone to take it seriously.It tells you to excuse the bad camera work which tries desperately at times to cover up the next thing it asks you to ignore, the pathetic acting abilities of all the unknown actors involved.Then we get to the story (if one could call it that) and the tissue paper thin plot. We begin at a going away party in New York for this guy Rob that gets interrupted by rumblings and explosions in the distance which which are being caused by some sort of monster. So then Rob, his cameraman and friends start heading out of New York when Rob gets a call from a girl (Beth) that he slept with one time, apparently is in trapped in her apartment. So Rob decides to go and save her and his friends for tag along for the ride. To quickly sum up, one by one all our main characters die either by a big monster, a little monster or an explosion.The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of a hand-held camera which for some reason has the longest battery life I've ever seen, and somehow is able to still function properly despite being dropped a couple of times and survive a helicopter crash.Overall, Cloverfield is filled with people pretending to be actors, A boring story with little or no explanation of much of anything, and one indestructible video camera.It is clear that the marketing campaign was where the majority of the budget for this movie went as this film was all hype and no substance. The hype for this movie was caused it go to the top of the box office in its first week and when word spread of how bad the film truly was, it sunk at box office falling in 5 weeks from 1st to 4th to 9th to 12th and the out of the top 20.If you really hated this movie as I did, check out rifftrax.com home of our friends from Mystery Science Theater who know a thing or two about bad movies. The running commentary given is perfect as they give this movie the beating it deserves. The problem with this film is not it's look, as it does look amazing, but it's length and  confusing nature.  Now if you've read the book then I dare say you'd have an idea what's going on but if you haven't then what I am told is an 'awesome epic' becomes a rather long film involving walking. And boy do they walk. they walk up hills, through forests, caves and over mountains. And then then walk some more! Another fault with the film is that although the cast has been assembled to be true to the book, none of them have any presence at all. It all makes you wish that someone with some charisma would turn up in a car and get on with it I am a big fan of Tolkien's books, but the movie doesn't do justice to them at all and actually is a major annoyance. The scenery and most of the personae are actually depicted very nicely, but as soon as acting and talking starts it becomes plain that the story has been cut, changed, dumbed down, and vulgarized to such a degree that nothing is left of Tolkien's masterpiece and what remains is just an over-length,  fantasy film with a thin story and boring characters.The film has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, its fundamental assumptions seem to be: (1) if a danger is such that the heroes just might escape then it's no real danger and must be enlarged to ridiculous proportions. (2) Comic relief can only be achieved through slapstick of the crudest kind. (3) Battle scenes must last at least as long as it would take a five-year-old to read the corresponding passages backward in Chinese. Moreover, if they could be done without special effects they are bad and must be "enhanced". (4) A traitor must walk around with a sign saying "I am a traitor".The worst example for this lack of subtlety is that the Ring is handled much too often, too openly, and with too little care. This trivializes the sinister and threatening item and takes away much of the power of the story.The reckless exaggeration in the "action scenes" is equally awful. Case in point the "Gate of Moria"-scene, when the Watcher gives Frodo a ride     in the merry-go-round until everyone had a chance to hack at him; the more restrained story in the book is much more effective IMHO. Similarly mutilated are the scenes: "Crossing of the Brandywine", "Cutting Cushions in Bree", "The Burning of the Riders" at Weathertop, "The Drowning of Sam Gamgee", "Wizards slug it out in Orthanc", and, of course, "They have a Cave Troll", and, really, all of Moria.
The main hero, Frodo, gives the impression of a loser: all the scenes in which (in the book) he shows courage, wisdom, resolve are cut or changed. Worst i find this in the key scenes in the Barrow (cut) and at Weathertop. There is nothing in the film giving any hint why Frodo might be "the best Hobbit in the Shire".Due to the many cut or twisted scenes, more than half of the characters have little resemblance to the ones in Tolkien's LotR: Frodo is a loser, Merry and Pippin are idiots until they suddenly turn out to be warrior princes, Elrond appears to be permanently pissed off -- as if everything "... stinks!", Strider is just another warrior hero (his being a loremaster, a healer, the "greatest traveller of our time" etc. does not show), Galadriel and Lorien is done so badly that i wish it would have been cut completely ("more fair than thought of mortal men" is a tall order, but Jackson does not even manage "fair"). Only Gandalf, Bilbo, and Saruman are rendered more or less well.I could go on, nearly every scene has gone wrong. Nothing of the depth of Tolkien's vision, the attention he paid to details (not only visual but to fine-tuning the development of the main characters) or the poetry in his creation is conveyed. What remains of the story is not told in a very coherent or convincing fashion, neither the acting nor the special effects are remarkable.All in all, a complete and utter failure to turn a great book into a movie. This film is sooooo over-rated. I'd never read the books so went into this with an open mind but was massively disappointed. It is without doubt one of the most boring films I have ever seen.At first I quite liked it even though the f/x were truly terrible and the acting a little wooden. But after the first half hour it turns into mindless drivel. The plot is very dull. A group of creatures have to take a ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they have to fight various monsters. And that goes on for 3 hours!! It was so mononetus that I almost fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during any film but this one really had me dozing off.It has a total lack of humor and emotion and the CGI effects are so fake looking that it ruins any sense of drama. Really, how scary is an army of blurry CGI monsters running at you?The action set pieces have no tension and you are left with a feeling of "Okay, hurry up and beat this monster so we can get to the next one!" That's what it's like. It has NO sense of excitment, danger or suspense and that has to be down to the terrible direction of Peter Jackson.The only joy I had watching this was laughing at some of the performances. Does Elijah Wood realise that he has ONE expression in the whole film? Does Cate Blanchette realise how rediculous her lines are? Do Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen realise that they look like rejects from an 80's heavy metal act? And what's with Ian McKellan? He's doing nothing more than a bad impression of Merlin the Wizard.In years to come this film will be regarded along the lines of Titanic and Independance Day. If it's lucky. This review contains SPOILERSAll qualities of the book were sacrificed for the sake of an action film full of cheap plot devices, gratuitous and often illogical story changes, and poor characterization. The scenery was actually great, if the camera would ever stop whirling around long enough to allow it to be enjoyed. I appreciate a sweeping camera move judiciously used to set off a dramatic vista, but that device was done to death. The action scenes are such a blitz of brief incoherent cuts that they were hard to watch. The lighting is frequently peculiar, for example everyone in Rivendell looked waxy and sallow. Then there is the music. I am afraid the composer has watched Conan the Barbarian a few two many times. Operatic choir music = bad guys, every time you see them. Yuk! Those are just the minor flaws in this piece of trash.The endless action cliches and cheap devices left me groaning at such a ham-handed treatment of Tolkien. From the sacrifice of Sam, Merry, and Pippin's characters for the sake of comedy, to the crumbling staircase in Moria, to the silly wizard battle between Gandalf and Saruman (complete with the dive off the tower, only to be caught by the eagle ploy). All of this was invented by Peter Jackson, as if the book does not provide enough exciting events to draw upon. It is a long book, and clearly cuts had to be made for a manageable movie. But to expend precious minutes on protracted combats and repetitious detail of Isengard, while leaving out important story and character development is truly sad. In fact, Jackson goes so far as to drag material belonging to The Two Towers (the shortest of the three books) into this movie (which is the longest of the three books).Many of these changes do nothing for the story, sometimes even weaken it. In the books Saruman is in it for himself, believing himself to be the one person who could stand up to Sauron, if only he had the ring. His view of things has been warped by Sauron's subtle control of what he sees through the Palantir. This is much more interesting than Saruman as the avowed lackey of Sauron. The former case makes sense of the treatment Saruman gets at the end of The Two Towers, while the later does not!The combat and action should have been brief, intense, and significant. In the book none of the combat with Boromir defending Merry and Pippin is seen, just the tragic result. The battle in Balin's tomb takes up 1 page out of 400. It is short, fierce, and to the point. The incident of Frodo turning out to be okay after being speared is actually rather funny in the book. In the movie this is blown so far out of proportion I thought I would gag. It is turned into the worst of manipulative `character is killed, oh no they are okay' scenes. And for those long minutes (and many others like them) they sacrificed the Barrow Downs? Frodo's `Cow Jumped Over the Moon' table dance? The hobbits actually getting to know and trust Strider on the way to Rivendell?The worst part is the butchery of the characters. Legolas loses his light-hearted singing nature. Gimli is a caricature from a bad D&D game, replete with Irish brogue. Absent was their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship, one of the hallmarks of the books. Hobbits go from the stealthy nimble people of the books to bumbling comic relief. In the book Sam is clever, loves all things elven, knows old ballads. In the movie he is just dumb and loyal. In the movie Merry and Pippin are turned into witless juvenile troublemakers sucked into the quest willy nilly, instead of dedicated friends conspiring with Sam to go on the quest to support Frodo. And Frodo's own strongest moment, when he defies the Nazgul at the river, is taken away, leaving him just a helpless victim dragged along. And finally, back to that ending battle: where is Aragorn's poignant agony watching the Fellowship fall apart under his leadership? And his tortured choice over which way to go? He doesn't have to make it, because the movie adds a scene between Frodo and him settling the matter.Then there are `the bad guys'. We can start with Sauron in the beginning. He looks like some sort of battle droid transformer monster. What is that?! He is a wizard, and in the history of Middle Earth is most famous for his guile and lies, not being a walking tank. The orcs: of course they are supposed to be scary and nasty. But they are in fact a people. It is clear throughout the books that they are more than beasts. Much of the beginning of The Two Towers hinges on their own politics and personalities, as do the events in Cirith Ungol in The Return of the King. But what we see in the movie are almost-zombies who hiss and growl and grunt a word or two. The biggest problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film is the complete lack of subtlety or mystery. It's all shown in full special effects glory, rather than hinted at as in the books. Have I been frightened at movies? Plenty of times. Was I ever frightened during this one? Never.In fact, that is the big flaw in all of this. Peter Jackson has no sense of subtlety. Everything is explicit and obvious and the viewer is clubbed over the head with it. The movie is informed less by the books than by the stereotype-ridden gaming genre that came out of it. If the movie I saw was in turn novelized, the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten a couple of years after publication. I am assuredly in the minority when I state Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is some of the worst film making I have ever seen. It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981.Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small. But they come out of very carefully crafted relationships and a deep well of subtext.I don't quarrel with the New Zealand locations, I do quarrel with the dumpy looking sets that were haphazardly glossed over with computer grafx fixes. I don't quarrel with the casting except Frodo, and yet I found the direction so superficial, and often perplexing, if not simply muddled (Galadriel as an English Vamp?!).A clue to my dissatisfaction can be found in the omission of Tom Bombadil, the only character in the original not affected by the Ring. His eccentric wisdom and unexplained powers ground the plot because there is something, someone who is outside the Dark Lord's power. There is in the Tolkien universe a power unimaginable which Sauron cannot touch. And that is essential to the fabric which holds Middle Earth together. Which Tolkien in his craft and his wisdom knew he had to give expression to. And Jackson in his foolhardiness ignored.Why didn't Jackson's team follow the books with more trust? The master had already worked it out perfectly. Well, almost. The Trilogy wasn't long enough, which Tolkien realized after its completion. Nevertheless, the project would have been immensely improved had Jackson and his team laid out a six episode franchise to match the six books of the Trilogy, taken more time to film it in their excellent locations of choice, and above all, truly paid homage to its original creator by following his work faithfully.These films are a mish-mash which titillated the masses for a brief time. And that is tragic, because it will be long, long before someone will be able to do them justice. Let's get one thing straight: I'm going to be... controversial... daring... notorious... I'm not going to say that this movie was "good". Shock. Horror.I was looking over the top 250 movies on imdb, and there was Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring sitting in fourth place. FOURTH place? How can this movie be the fourth greatest movie to EVER be created? How? Especially when you find masterpieces such as Schindler's List, American Beauty and Das Boot propping up the pile. It's not a surprise; there's no doubt in my mind that the next two films will also grace the top ten: all three of them, gleaming in a line. But why? Am I the only person in the entire world who DOESN'T think this is "one of the greatest films of all time", "best ever", "sensational"?It's amazing  but when I was asked, "What did you think of Lord of the Rings?" and I had the plain audacity to reply with "It's alright, I s'pose  average", I was greeted with an array of shocked faces. It's like the film no one can criticise. And if you do, you're clearly insane, and deserve to be locked up.As for what I made of the film itself, it started off well  characters developing nicely, interesting storyline. It was once Frodo set off with the ring that things went downhill. This probably originates from the book, but why was everything hidden in the mountains of doom, in the land of evil behind the trees of terror? Did everything really have to be that over-the-top? Even down to the whole: black = bad, white >good?I've not read the book (I also never, ever intend to)  I'm ignorant, clueless, no chance of ever getting it', BUT... when I came out of the cinema, I couldn't even tell you the names of half the characters, let alone anything about their personalities. You form a fellowship, and you'd expect one or two alliances/disagreements to occur. Barely anything. In fact, I was surprised any of them even cared when Gandalf fell over the edge. There was just no depth. It was all action, action, action  and no relationships or much development of characters. Even in The Terminator, you at least knew one or two things about the main characters. What makes a great masterpiece of a film is having action, drama, strong characters, etc. As far as I can tell, the only plus side of this film is the special effects.
A few other points to add...Firstly, half-way through the film, when they arrived at the Elvin village, it almost felt like the film was over. There was all the closure of, "we're safe now..." and not even any cross-cutting back to the black riders. When the fellowship finally set off (a good hour and a half into the film!) it felt like another film was starting.Gollum  the most un-scary thing. Ever. Oh, and the scene where the fellowship were hiding, and one of the hobbits knocked something over  was that meant to be quite so funny?Aragorn and Boromir look near-identical. This is most confusing.3 hours is just too long. Unless the film is worth it. And this one isn't. I dread to think what sitting through the director's cut must be like...
If anyone out there agrees with me, track down the spoof version of this by French and Saunders. That is sheer brilliance.Anyway, I'm off to live in a cave until 2010, when the Lord of the Rings hype should've died down sufficiently. Unless it's anything like Star Wars. In which case, I'll see you 30 years.I can't help but wonder, I wonder if this film would've been successful if not for the huge amount of propaganda and anticipation, which just wasn't deserved?But then again, if this film hadn't been so successful, would I have been so critical?It was probably worth a 7 out of 10. However, it painted itself as an off-the-scale 10. So I'll give it a 1 instead. Ha. Longest torture ever possible! I have hated many movies before but this one i have to use superlatives because it was long as well as bad. I have read Tolkien's The Hobbit, and i will accept that i am not big fan of such fantasy concepts yet i liked the way he wrote the book and after hearing such big things about this movie was really eager to see it. But what a royal wastage of time!!! What could have been a real good movie has been treated so slow, so insanely that i can't believe people actually went to theaters to watch the second movie. I mean isn't it like first movie is what makes the sequels work, here the first movie is so bad that i can't figure out how did the others work? And how can someone kill the army of dark forces by just hitting stones at them? How can someone have so many arrows without ending them up? What was the scene where the Hobbit drops some stuff into the well supposed to convey? So many questions unanswered? Its not only these points that make me feel bad for the movie, there are numerous others, its just that these are the only ones i can remember now. Never knew it would be so bad. Sorry if i am hurting many people, but really i am still trying to figure out how could people like it and rate it so high. No way Jose from my side. First of all, most people who praise this film did NOT read the books. The books are amazing but cannot work as film. Maybe that is why no one has undertaken this epic until now. What I can't understand was how people can praise all the different aspects of it. The costuming and sets were the only thing decent. My complaints? Too many liberties were taken with the book. Now, I'm not referring to the plot elements (which were more or less intact except for Tom Bombadil. If you don't know who that is, read the book!) but the style that Tolkien worked so hard to preserve in all of his books. The first item that was ruined in the first 5 minutes was the mystery of Sauron. Sauron is such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him. Tolkien keeps this throughout all the books. Jackson ruined that in 5 minutes. Next, the action always follows the hobbits. This put you in the place of the hobbits. What characters would be better for an audience to identify with? They were as much outsiders to this strange world as we are. Unfortunately, Jackson ruined that also.The directing was nothing spectacular. It was unobtrusive, but there was no style really, so it did not add any more depth to the movie. The acting was pretty good, but it could not save the movie from the unforgivable sins that the movie committed to the book.The special effects, though praised, were not good at all. You'd think since they have to do 3 films with hobbits that they would come up with a good way to do them and stick to it. Not the case! The hobbits change size drastically throughout the film depending on the technique that is being used to reduce them. Sometimes they are children, but the worst is when they just put them further from the camera. How is that supposed to work? Although we do not have depth perception in the theater, the audience can still tell when the size difference is only created by the perspective. The CG effects were not outstanding, but after seeing Star Wars: Episode 1, it was nice to know costumes can still be used well.Now, if I had not read the book, would I have a better view of this film? You bet, but too many things from the book were ruined to make it more of a conventional movie. Even still, I definitely would not think it is worthy of being ranked so high on IMDB.com. This film is long.  It goes on and on and on, and just when you think it is finished, it goes on a bit more, and then, when it finally does finish, it just stops.  Rubbish.Lovely scenery, fight scenes quite good, and that's it.I have never fallen asleep at the cinema before but I did today and it was a blessed relief as, for me, the film was only six hours long as I was asleep for the middle two.Avoid this film.  At all costs.  Even more, avoid the kind of dullard lunatics who will say this was fantastic and you must read the books. Don't read the books - they are worse.Stay at home, rent a proper movie, watch it twice, make some tea, watch it again and you will still have used up less of your short life than by watching this terrible, terrible movie.God it was bad. Ok, so forget all the hype and think about it for a second.  3 hours in which nothing much happens except a bit of walking and then a bit of fighting does not a good film make. There may be those who are fans of the book and I don't doubt that to them this is a great film. But to anyone else who have never ventured into the world of Tolkien then it is a huge let down.  There seems to be too much reliance on knowledge from the book as none of the characters seem to have any back story and we haven't got a clue to why they are prepared to take on the quest.The action scenes are few and far between and when they do come they seem a bit lacklustre. The acting is nothing special and there are some scenes (The council meeting) where the effects people must have taken the day off. Which leaves the walking... there's a lot of it. In fact they're some of the best bits as New Zealand looks very nice. However that's all that gets done and after a while I was convinced that the film was going to show and advert for Millets or the Rambling association at the end. Painfully dull though if  rambling or fantasy is not your thing. This comment contains spoilers in that it directs you join me in seeing through the thin veil of Hollywood, and directs you inward to know what you really need and want instead of just explosions and effects...Seriously, this could have been one of the best movies ever made.  That's right, I'm saying it is not.  Even the casual movie fan (movie fan, not one of the mindless herd) has to admit that he/she can sense the fear in the producer's hearts behind every scene in this movie.  They took a great risk in making an expensive trilogy like this, and they did not want to get the short end of the stick.  The result is a compromise;  a combination of good effects and good acting counterpointed with unnecessary cheeze-ball action and, well, bad acting.  The result is a bizarre movie with brilliant scenes followed by terrible scenes.Everyone knows the plot summary, so I will skip it.Every cool scene of dialogue, every touching moment between old friends, and every time we felt the pull of evil, we were quickly (before any of the sheep dozed off), bombarded with a scene of the gang struggling along on their trek fighting creatures and getting blown up.Apparently, according to my friends, I was the only person who noticed the tragedy in the cave troll.  After slowly being disappointed for several hours, I was quite pleased to see the action take an interesting turn like this.  When the cave troll was led into the room, and had a collar on with a "leash" (a chain).  Right away I assumed he was a trained beast, made ferocious by being beaten and tortured over time by his master, much like some people do with pit bull dogs, etc...  When the troll was fatally shot through the mouth by the arrow, he had on his face a moment of unexpected (for me) realization of the wrongness of his actions.  Perhaps this was brought on by his own severe pain and sense that his life would be over in a few moments.  When I was ridiculed for this by my friends, I said perhaps I was just trying to read something interesting into this unnecessary action.
Elijah Wood.  I had trouble at first putting a description to his particular form of bad acting.  I came up with the phrase, "blank acting", because he always has that one blank look on his face.  You know the one, and the example that comes to mind is the look on his face in the scene where the ring "accidentally falls through the air and lands directly over his finger".  A friend of mine found a review that had a better description than mine:  "What he does is not acting, it is face-making, and anyone can do it".Is this a good movie?  As much as "Gladiator" was a good movie, so is this one.  I know the mass herd of movie go-ers return over and over again to see John Woo (and Ridley Scott) and whoever else who claim to have a "new" movie where they just blow stuff up in the same old predictable way, and the people that made this movie know it too.  In order to preserve their bank accounts, they put the explosions in for the sheep to wow over.  My plea for the future is this: If you are going to take a risk, take it and don't compromise.  Make a great film.  Don't let Hollywood or anyone shape all of your craft into one boring blob.  If you can't do that, then you are not a real movie maker. I've seen this movie and I dont see what all of the fuss is about. Its not that great and i dont know why people think it is. I struggled to stay awake and fell asleep several times trying to watch this movie. It a tedious movie and once you finally get into the movie it ends.I'm not saying it was a horribly bad movie or anything I just dont understand why people think it is so good. The movie isnt that good folks. It isn't. The STORY (over the three volumes as purists want to say, it is all one story just published as three volumes]) is good, and the movie looks fantastic and looks what one imagines in the mind as the reader reads, but it doesnt make a good movie.The movie stinks.  Just like Episode 1 stinks.  But "everybody" loved it when it came out except 1000 people in the world. I was one. Believe me, in a few years, you wont think this is such a great movie.  only if one watches all 3 LOTR movies does one think it s good.  by themselves, they stink. After all of the build up leading up to this movie, I was vastly disappointed.  It was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Granted there were moments- like the beautiful villages of the Hobbits and the Elves.  Absolutely breathtaking.  But over all the movie was too dark and gory.  Much more so than the book.  The movie overrode the book in many places to have long, drawn out battles.  Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was something out of "Carrie," it was too bizarre to be believed.  Casting 20 somethings to play 40-50'ish year old Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, et al.) also struck a jarring note.  Over all a very bad, highly unfaithful adaptation of a very fine work that deserved better justice.  I do not what the academy is thinking with all of it nominations!! I found the changes made in the story line showed Mr. Jackson did not understand the book, -at all.  His his replacing the character of Glorfindel, a warrior, with Arwen, a Lady of the Realm (turned female warrior for no apparent reason other than to attract Xena fans), completely destroys the point of the Tolkien trilogy.  He simply can not undo the damage he has done with this "substitution".  A significant segment in "Return of the King" hinges on the fact that there are not female warriors.I am so disappointed in the film and will not be watching any of the following installments.I just wish Mr. Jackson had bothered to read the books before he butchered them. it is with the greatest displeasure and disappointment that i find myself sat writing this review. having read all 6 of the rings novels i found myself baffled and confused by what i had assumed was a prequel to the hobbit. plot holes a plenty and a considerably stripped down cast (no gandalf, fro-do, or samwise!!) the scene in the crack of doom has been replaced by a video tape showing a small girl sat down a well. i can only assume this is down to budgeting restraints. the much loved council of riven dell has been replaced by a mental hospital. whilst i applaud the directors attempt to create a modern day lord of the rings i cannot condone anything which would make my 3 year old son cry as much as he did when the horse leaped tragically to his doom from the ship and into the unforgiving waves beneath, and i can neither understand nor forgive why Jackson replaced the final and climatic scene at the crack of doom with a black haired girl (presumably the wraith king) clambering from a television set and into the living room of a man obviously too large to be fro-do. why oh why is it so difficult for Hollywood to stick to the books? As a huge LOTR fan from early childhood, it pains me to write this review - but they've completely missed it! The Lord Of The Rings is about, and should be about, and always has been about two things: story and atmosphere, both of which are missed completely in this film.As any other epic story, the plot needs time to develop and breathe, as such, thus creating a connection, on a very deep emotional level with the heroes. What the production team in this case had done, is crammed a huge story into three hours that make a VERY boring viewing. Boring, since the story has no credibility whatsoever when you don't understand why the heroes are where they are at, how they got there, or how long it took them to get there. All it leaves you with, is looking forward to the battle scenes, in which you will find yourself thinking: 'yeah right, whatever', on more than one occasion.On top of that, or rather because of all that, with the exception of Sir Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, the heroes seem ridiculous and pathetic and you are left feeling completely indifferent to them! Unheard of! Indifferent to the heroes of the LOTR! Oh dear, you got it SO wrong! Shame! Whenever I think about this film, I can't help but thinking about Gladiator, which I thought was fantastically written and executed. LOTR HAD the potential to be as good, but, and it pains me to say that, is not even in the same league.My money back please. As I started seeing the commercials for this movie I was convinced that this would be a typical fairy tale movie, not worthy of being seen.Until today I was definitely not going, but as circumstances went I wound up at the theater at 2pm, almost late, but in time for the start.The movie started nice - black stuff all over and bad guys who look like they need a lot of facial hair to cover their ugliness were all over the place.The middle was "interesting" - a lot of run and other stuff, comparable to run. Scenery was outstanding.The end was, uh, gone. Where did the end go? Someone quickly think of another hour for the ending. The end left things pretty unfinished, since the good guys neither died nor won. I think another 3 long hours for the finish would be added as a sequel or something.At the end I would say that the only thing good about this was the scenery and the cast. Nothing else is worth spending $8 and sitting in a chair for 3 hours. The plot seems full, long - 3 hours long, the story seems involving, but not to me. Overall I heard a lot of people say "why did I come here", or saw people leave a good hour before the thing was officially over.I've heard a lot of people who've already read the book say it's good and at the same time a lot of people that haven't say it's awful.If you really need to find out if it's good or not you should go see it, but if you trust me - rent it a month later for a lot less. the problem of the movie is mainly that it is made to be liked by as many people as possible, and that´s never a good start for anything. i don´t like jacksons personal visions of the book. he degraded the horrifying black riders to nothing more than weak actionfigures. saruman is too early and often shown, so he can´t be as fear-creating as he is in the book. his (jacksons) direction is more or less unsatisfying, and the acting is -with the exception of hugo weaving (elrond)- bad. jackson would have done good respecting that "the lord of the rings" is no romance but some sort of great "fantasy road movie". missing bombadil and good-fitting music (from rosenman) i will by any time prefer the bakshi animated-feature from 1978 (although it´s incomplete, and bombadil is missing too.. someone finish this movie, pleeeeease).. i´m personally disappointed that a great man like howard shore (crash, silence of the lambs, dead ringers, existenz, the fly, ed wood) could do such a boring score. Ok, I admit, I liked The Mummy movies. They are fun, totally unpretentious, have good CGI..are a good way to eat some popcorn...yet not what I call 'high cinema' by any means..but then again, it doesnt set out to be, so  I enjoy it for what it is.  Sigh...maybe  Jackson really meant to make a Mummy movie. If thats true, then its a shame considering the source material he had to work with.Don't get me wrong..the movie was good, worth seeing,   very entertaining, and surely better than Phantom Menace- but only just so. While Phantom Menace only had Lucas' feeble literary  talents to rely on, FOTR had (supposedly) THE greatest fantasy novel of all time, the template by which other series are based, the creator of 'fantasy' as we know(and love) it today.  So why was the film so paltry?  The reason is that Jackson like Lucas fell victim to the same faux pas...Faux Pas #1-Assumption of prior familiarity:  Lucas relied on the audience's past knowledge(and love) of the SW world to 'carry them' thru the film and supply all the emotion(not good).  Similarly, Jackson's movie did the same. I was introduced into alot of characters in this movie and b/c of the frenetic pacing and abysmal screenplay, I only definitively knew the names of say 5 characters-maybe.  I had no insight into who they were, what drove them, what their relationships to others were..nothing. Most of the characters, save maybe Gandalph and Frodo were limited to 2D, at best, rendering them mere props and not the grand characters I imagine they are in Tolkein's novels. Thus I had the feeling that had I read the book, alot of what happened would have made more sense and I would have cared what happened to the characters.I would have been involved and 'pulled' into the film. As it was..I was interested in what happened...but not horribly affected either way by what did happen, a few scenes aside.Faux Pas #2-Ok granted...I say Lucas did better in this respect...character interrelationships. Quite frankly, I saw very little of what made the "fellowship' an actual fellowship other than the 'annointing' at Rivenden(another place I didnt know the name of til I went to chat after the movie). It seemed to me the reaction by the fellowship to Gandaph's 'passing' was amusingly exaggerated(eps with the violins in the background)..when you consider that half of them had only met the man (what seemed like) days ago. I saw nothing to hint at any nature of a relationship between most of the characters,excpet for maybe Frodo and Gandalph.  The boys meet Strider..they go off with him for no apparent reason.  Strider has a lady love..they have a scene for seemingly no reason as I was not given any back info to show me why I should care about them.  It seemed to me that Arwen was a horribly contrived characer...her only raison d'entre being to save Frodo's life...Deus ex Machina to the nth degree.  Then Gimli(another name I learned after the movie)utters the trite 'the felloship is broken' while the whole time I'm like 'well...its only been a few days..that was a quick dissolvement  and besides...its not like they are chums anyway'.  It just seemed to me that the movie threw conclusions at you, but gave you no reasonable build up or preparation.  I mean..come on...we see them travel on foot on a mountain, but after that all of a sudden  they have a horse named Bill that apparently is dear to them?!?Please.Faux Pas #3 Too Many smoke and mirrors at the expense of storytelling-Here Lucas and Jackson both failed miserably. But...at least where Lucas did it, he did it well. I really cant beleive comments that say the visuals were breath taking. Yes some of the scenery was really good, and some of the CGI was grand.  But  the rendering in some of the scenes was just horrible-I mean..In Ep 1 I know everything was not real, but at least the parts that werent were not GLARINGLY fake..the scene with the cave troll was just laughable.  The Balrog...good, but how can I be scared of this 'monster' when 9  character  have just outrun  1000  baddies....and no the graphics were not 'groundbreaking' for it either.  The cinematography during the CGI scenes too often seemed blurry...I felt sorry for the folks up front during those scenes. So, on the whole I felt the graphics were derivative and in some cases dowright bad.  I saw better eye candy in Shrek and FF this year. But, so as not to seem to nitpicky Ill say this...the effects I can live with, as long as I get a good story with good characters..story was good but woefully failed in part 2 for me.Faux Pas #4-this one belongs to Jackson alone...Condensation of an Epic Story.  And no, I dont mean condensation in terms of what was or was not in the books b/c I havent read them. I mean in terms how...if this story is so epic, sweping and grand...how come it feels like it took 10 days?  We are told how far it is to get to Rivvendale(i think?)..yet, three days later wham! here we are.  Gandalph leaves frodo, journeys to a place seemingly 2 blocks away from Mt. Doom and comes back to the shire in what seems like hours.  We are told the Fellowship are in for a long perilous journey..yet seemingly 2 days later, there they are in the mines, halfway there.   Now granted...time is a concern..but surely they could have done something...some scenes of them 'on the road'(and not of them just arriving at the place they need to be), maybe some change of seasons.the only snow I saw was at the top of a mountain..yet, when they visit Cate Blanchett it seems sunny and warm again like it was when they set out.Or how about even some wear and tear on the characters..something, a voice over saying how many 'moons' had passed, something.  Given the pacing of the movie  I lost alot of the 'epic scope' Id hoped a film like this would possess. It made it feel horribly rushed like everything in between battles was just the set up to get to another battle....Like another movie I know...like The Mummy.-AN 7 out of 10 stars ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ i barely sat through this movie once but when i had to watch it a second time i simply feel asleep. This movie was a combination of bad acting and bad writing. It is no where near as good as some people say. i don't care how many awards it got. It was such a waste of time. I mean come on, Elijah Wood can't act to save his life, and the guy that played 'Sam' was a good actor in other stuff i saw him in but he was terrible in this. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt though and assume it was the writing. I mean i can get past the cheesiness of Star Wars because I love both the original and the new trilogies but LOTR is ridicules! I know this is just my opinion but i mean you're insane if you honestly thing this movie deserved awards. I had been meaning to see this one for a while, but never got round to it, eventually managed to see it on the saturday after episode II opened, (the screens not showing star wars all being eerily quiet)All i can say is how very very boring!  I really wanted to like this film, my friends said they enjoyed it, but really, where was it going, it was just the worst three hours spent of my life, it is worse than Episode I and i HATE that film.I found myself totally uninterested in the characters, when the Gandolf died, i was not in the slightest bit bothered, i had no immotional connection to the characters and really did not care for them.The film is overlong in the extreme, and nothing happens!  there are a few measly little battle scenes and that is it.  I can't help but feel that if this wasn't part of the LOTR franchise it would have sunk without trace, if it had not been LOTR no-one would have put up with this three hour treck.In three words BORING BORING BORING (and i usually like these sort of films) I know it's a matter of taste, but I CANNOT believe this film is rated so highly!!!??? I found it to be an awful, pompous, humourless, simple-minded, way too long film for any sane person to sit through and - even more bewildering - enjoy. Whether it's the zillion childish fantasy names that get thrown at you constantly, or the seemingly endless string of battle sequence after battle sequence without any real dramatic development ("oh my! watch out! yet another group of really weird looking gnomes out to kill us, quick, that way everybody!! Phewww... we just barely survived - on to the next!"), or the annoyingly dreamy blue eyes of the main character, or the simplistic way of looking at good vs. evil - i just couldn't stand it. If it wasn't for my girlfriend who loves the Tolkien books and who i ha d promised to give it a fair shot (which i REALLY did), i probably would've walked out after 45 minutes at the latest. Kitschy, over-budgeted, highly overrated heroic fantasy spectacle - Yuk. Finally took in Lord of the Rings and I'm wondering why this movie is so highly praised (#4 of all time? - not even close).  The battle scenes are far too cheesey Western/"A-Team"ish (1,000 bullets flying around (arrows in this case) and no one gets hit - except of course the "bad" guys).  The dialogue was hard to hear on more than one occasion because the background music was so LOUD and the special effects were not all that "special".  In fact, based on the technology of the time, The Wizard of Oz runs circles around Lord of the Rings.  Finally, as other's have mentioned, each movie should be it's own entity.  The ending was a total let down. After watching LOTR and cursing it as the worst movie of the year, I decided to take a look at the books to see what the fuzz is all about. Well, the reading of "The fellowship of the ring" made me reconsider my opinion. The movie it's A LOT WORSE after reading it. I liked the book, but it will not be in my favorite list.I can't stand the great deal of people who are claiming that "Peter Jackson did a wonderful job adapting the book to the screen" and that "it couldn't be better" without even reading the book!Many people say, "it's impossible to adapt a book to the screen". Well, guess what, it's not. If you watch and read "The godfather" you'll know what I mean. I consider the movie even superior than the book, it's pecfect in every way. Another good example it's "2001: A space oddisey", while in this case the book is superior, the movie it's a very good work. The list goes on: Gone with the wind, Lawrence of arabia, A clockwork orange, The wizard of Oz, The grapes of wrath, blah, blah. I guess that LOTR it's not even one of the 100 greatest adapted screenplays of all-time.First of all, the events in the book are slowly revealed, a little bit at a time, it makes the whole thing much more interesting. In the movie we start with a voice-over spoiling us all the emotion and trying to make us think "wow, this movie is gonna be great, look at that big monster".Second, everything in the book happens for good reason. A lot of scenes from the book appear in the film, but their reason it's very different. For example the parting of Frodo from the shire has a lot more of preparation, planning and help from his hobbit-friends, why? If you want to know, read the book, it's explained there with a lot of detail. In the movie it's off-and-go, for no reason at all. I have to say this also about Merry and Pippin, in the movie they're pointless. Another bad scene, this one involving snow, comes to my mind.Third, middle-earth it's portrayed in the book with great detail, it's very real. I can imagine every square-inch of it, the vegetation, animals, climate, soil, etc. In the book we see it mostly as a CGI generated background and it looks fake.Fourth, acting. This is the worst part of the movie. The dialog it's just stupid, it makes the characters look like cardboard. They take themselves too seriously, and they speak as if they were reading some ancient sacred text. The book has this feeling also, but the book pretends to feel like an ancient sacred text. Also, everyone has the same facial expression trough the whole movie (specialy Frodo).Fifth, in the book, the pacing it's very slow. It gives us the impression that middle-earth it's a slow place. That the news take months to travel from town to town. There's no technology, but there's history, culture, myth, art and traditions. Frodo is scared to death when he hears that black riders were seen in this town, or in that place. Every time closer. In the movie, we only see Frodo being chased by scary-looking men in black, who made us say: "Look, the bad guys". Also, in the movie we see people killing bad guys at an incredible fast rate, then, after they managed to escape in an unconvincing way with help from someone you didn't expect, they kill more bad guys.AND ABOVE ALL, THE ENDING. Please!!!! This is the result of making the three movies at the same time. It just fades to black in the middle of the story. Altough the book ending it's very similar, it leaves you satisfied, and wanting to know that will happen next. The movie just stops. I guess the next movie will begin from the next frame this one finished. Amazing that the ending didn't catched up Frodo in the middle of a word.In my opinion, this movie it's bad, and it drags on forever. Ask yourself this questions, I give you my answers:1. Is it innovative? No, there are a lot of movies which use the techniques used here. 2. Is it original? No, adapting a book to the screen it's done by Hollywood in a regular basis. If you say that the story it's original, then you're really saying that the book it's original. 3. Does it have great fx? I don't think so. This movie uses almost the same fx techniques than "Star Wars: The phantom menace". If the effects were somewhat different, they weren't real enough. Even "Jurassic Park" fx are better 4. Does it have memorable scenes? No, even the death of Gandalf was laughable.Overall, I have given my opinion before and after reading the book. And my conclusion it's this: This is the second most over-rated movie of all times (the first one it's Titanic). It's nothing new, original or great. Too bad that the other two movies are already finished, because they're gonna be just like this one.
