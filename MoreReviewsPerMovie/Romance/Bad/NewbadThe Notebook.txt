It's not that I dislike romance anything but this has movie tries so hard to be some sort of acronym to the word "chick flick" that it ends up shooting you to death with it's intended love arrows. Now could it be that I can't relate the alleged lovers in this movie? I mean I wasn't born in the 30s, I'm not a soldier so I was never in any wars (haven't we seen enough WW2 stories by the way?) and of course I don't have any family as of yet. But surely the universal power love is something everyone can relate to? Especially when depicted by a movie that uses no other element to drive its plot. Think again, the definition of love shown in this film is so naive, sugar-coated and completely oblivious of anything in the real world that it makes Star Wars look like something from the Discovery channel.The so called "couple" in this film are only in love because the movie says they are, not because there's any sort of chemistry between the actors and not because the characters themselves even act like. Even Allie's alleged interest in painting felt so tacked on shallow and fake it made my head hurt. Speaking of Allie, it actually infuriates me to see the character acting like she has absolutely no control over her libido because the sex is just about the only thing the couple seems to have in common, and the only thing, aside from arguing, that they enjoy doing together. And yet this movie is supposed to be oh so romantic.It's by some small miracle that this movie got the raving reviews it did, luckily it seems most of those were given by teenage girls and their tool boyfriends (no Oscars or anything) so I don't have to completely give up on humanity yet. If one day your girlfriend suddenly shows up all lyrical about this movie and wants it to "share it with you" I'd strongly advise any guy to end that relationship pronto. Your girlfriend will obviously already have built up her own twisted fantasy of what a relationship should be like, a fantasy that no guy, live or dead, could possibly live up to. Stay away. Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: I'm a girl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching the movie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two long and excruciating hours, I just couldn't help to think that this must've been the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. The lead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling really disappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions was basically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what's up with the character of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho? Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was really pretty, and that's basically it. And the ending... Oh, the ending! It was so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What's heartbreaking and sad about it is a mystery to me. I don't know, maybe I just can't see the grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don't wish to come across it again. My wife and I watched The Notebook last night. Within ten minutes we were furious at how slow, cliché, and predictable it was. And then it just got worse and worse. It was so very very bad that we were actually drawn to watch in perverse, embarrassed horror as each scene plodded through stale, obvious dialog, and the actors tried to salvage what was obviously a terrible muddle by overacting. I can't begin to convey just how awful this movie is, in every sense. Leave aside the horrendously dull, cliché-ridden script, the terrible acting, the ham-fisted directing, the swelling tear-jerker music, and the incredibly obvious plot -- Even the freaking costumes were terrible. The fake facial hair looked like it was done by 3rd-graders. If movies are meant to fascinate, then this one did all right. I consider this the worst film I have seen in at least five years, but rarely if ever have I (and my wife) been compelled to stay all the way through such abysmal crap out of some sort of hilarious anger at how were were wasting our own time. I mean we were jumping on the couches ad screaming in warped glee as each predictable plot point was tediously checked off the director's checklist. All the way to the very last shot (in the backstory) of her coming back and them hugging in a swirl of stock sentimental string music -- OF COURSE SHE'S COMING BACK. And the front story? They, uh, die TOGETHER? My God. We could not stop howling. Was he even sick? No. He just died -- just because! Because it went with the sickeningly sweet music, I guess. Then I come here expecting to be vindicated and I find a bunch of comments by people who were actually taken in by this plodding, pathetic drivel. What in the world is up? I usually am with IMDb folks on their 7.8s, but man alive, folks, step away from the Kool-Aid. there are three things I look for in movies, quality acting, a good script, and originality of the story...this movie had none of these. Could it have been any more cliché? the only thing that impressed me was Allie's wardrobe and the car she was driving. I've seen better acting on lifetime! and so many unnecessary parts that are completely pointless. "A walk to remember" is about a hundred times better and it didn't get half the attention this movie did. If you're not aware already, it's based on a book by the same author as "the notebook". if you want to see a moving love story you'll be disappointed from this film unless you're 13...can't believe all the rave...it is not deserved...a total waste of my time... I'm sorry. This movie is one of THE Chick Flicks of our time, and I just hated it. I get angry when people begin to discuss it at parties. My eyes flash and roll, my pulse quickens, and my breath whooshes out in indignation. Rachel McAdams was absolutely brilliant in "Mean Girls", but she had no place in this role. Adorable dimples are not a good enough reason for casting. Ryan Gosling was appropriately creepy in "Murder by Numbers", but again, not right for this romantic role. Drippy dialog and weak acting aside, here was my main problem with the movie. He never tried to find her. Why did he send the letters to her home (where her disapproving mother was) instead of to her at school? Why did he never try to visit her at school or write to her at school? Why did she never try to write to him the entire time she was away at school? I could not buy the greatest love story of all times from these two, because they didn't even try. And unfortunately, neither actor won me over through the plot flaws. I can't believe someone agreed to make a film from this script. Everything is so blatantly obvious and no character goes through a journey. They are all one dimensional and boring. There is no suspension let alone any twists.Saying all this, the photography is good and the acting isn't that bad. Still this doesn't warrant 2 stars.Ah, yes, I'll just mention there are some uninspiring sex scenes and the film is also at least half an hour too long.If you want to see a great love story where you feel with he characters and don't know why or how until the end, check The English Patient. "I am no one special. Just a common man with common thoughts. I've lead a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten. But in one respect I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived. I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and for me that has always been enough."Right. Are you sure it was enough? For you still had to write a "gloriously" stupid book (and make a "gloriously" stupid movie based on it)! Not only stupid. Trite, empty, boring... A glorious disaster!The characters are dull! Noah is what? Manic-depressive? Manic in the first 5 minutes, and throughout the rest of the movie depressive. Does he even fit the elderly character (you know, the grandpa who winks to young nurses)? Of course not. On the contrary, Allie is always hysterical, and all I got to hear were her constant screams. She seems and sounds like she's trying to reanimate a dead person. (Noah?) That person would probably kill her after the outcome and then peacefully die again. I think she would do perfect in a role of the serial killer's principal victim. Explicit edition only!The music is simply unbearable!!!And what about the children? There is only one scene with the all three of them! How superficial does one need to be, to put them in only one scene, and have us believe that they are actually a big part of their grand love and happy fairy tale life? The daughter says "Dad come home, we miss you". But dad had more important issues. He loved mom so much that he had to call on the whole divine/ demonic/ extraterrestrial/ voodoo/etc gang to make them die together?! Touchy. Who cares about children anyway.And sooooooo many other bugs... Damn I don't even know why I'm writing this. I feel like one of Jeffrey Dahmer's zombies. Even that should feel better than being this numb after watching this piece of... you know what.The only good thing about this movie is Joan Allen's performance. I found this movie offensive, It's popularity is telling of the selfish delusional expectations and lack of consideration for anybody other than the couple, in fact the couples happiness should be at the expense of every other person, even when they are portrayed in good character.Unlike other "love story / chick flick" components to movies such as titanic etc, the guy she left, who she also happened to be unfaithful to, for her "true love", was portrayed as a nice guy throughout the movie. No sympathy was attributed to this guy even though his loss was at the expense of her.Another example of this was shown that the couple had 4 children ranging from young teen to adult. When the movie ended with the pair of them in bed both expiring at the same time, several people claim this was a happy event (a good way to go). Well it is for the 2 people, rather the one that would not have outlived the other and thus would not suffer the loss. However, they are not the only 2 people in the world, there were 4 children. I have had the misfortune of losing a parent. If I lost both at the same time, I don't think I would have thought that was such a happy event. This is another example of the focus on the "love / romance" at any cost to others. This happens in a lot of movies, but normally it happens less and the loss is to the "bad guy".It goes to show how most women in our society (primarily at a young age) will over value (to say the least) the "love / romance" (if you want to call it that) at the expense of anybody else's happiness - even when they are portrayed as good characters. What a predictably maudlin movie. Rather than list the clichés used here, it would be easier to list the clichés passed up.Here's one...give it 110%. This movie gives about 30% at best. The actors are sleepwalking so it seems. The only emotion in the movie (the awkward courtship/love scenes and Allie's annoying habit of squealing) are painful to watch.I only watched it to the end to make sure the two old fools died (everyone knew withing 15 minutes of the start what the situation was).Which makes it reminiscent of Titanic for me where I was hoping every minute after the first 60, that Leonardo DiCaprio would just die already. ...You may cry out due to complete boredom and instances of sudden outbursts of laughter due to this movie's all-round stupid and unrealistic plot. Just so sad to see two fabulous, classic actors accept supporting roles in a poorly written movie; with countless obvious mistakes, many being historical in nature; from a terrible book.I think if they had a different writing team, different researchers!, and ditched those two awful youth actors (who belong in teen flicks and those stupid giant lizard and shark movies on the Sci-Fi channel), the movie may have been good if the focus was on the late stages of their life and not the early. When they were young, it was all totally unrealistic cloudy rolls in the hay, giant rivers filled with birds and a wet sundress contest and pouty fights. But the roles Gena Rowlands and James Garner were totally different and could really make a wonder movie.The many historical flaws were very distracting. Such as her jewelry styles. The types of pearls a betrothed upper class girl at her age were totally wrong. Also the lack of progression of the fashions through the decade of their youth is wrong especially for someone w/ money.Unusually, I would say read the book, but that was just as bad. My recommendation is watch a different movie! Oh and I SO totally agree with dallas_viewer 's review! This person hit it on the nose! Also kj_justice 's review is spot on except for the Disney comment. Sappy Disney romance is one kind I always love! :-) OK,you might find this unusual,but if you are a hater of this movie and Chick Flicks in general(like me),then you won't be surprised.In fact,you might be delighted.See,i'm a 12 year old girl and i HATE chick flicks,because they are so sappy,unrealistic,uninteresting,WAY too cliché,and it gets to your head if you don't watch it.And when girls fall for this ****,they will start making their own fantasy about how life and love is,which will ultimately go wrong.Every time my mom and sisters talk about Chick Flicks,it makes me gag.They always say it is the best movie ever which i know for a fact that neither of those movies the deem as "the best movie ever" are no match to "Casablanca" and "The Godfather".Since i was bored,i decided to look into the bad reviews of this movie since i love bad reviews since they are so funny and spot on and i found myself laughing in delight at all of the jokes about how awful and predictable this film was and how i wasn't the only one that hated this film.I knew i wasn't the only one,i couldn't have been the only one,but still.So,when i was reading the reviews,i started thinking,why not do one of my own?Since i love doing reviews.And i never tried a bad one before either!So,this is where the review comes in.I'll start saying how i first saw this.My mom just took the movie form our grandma,she had a stroke recently at the time,so we just took the film anyway.We were all so psyched and i was psyched because i thought i would finally see a good movie.I couldn't have been more WRONG!First of all,like all Chick Flicks,the story,if there actually was one,was boring,unoriginal,uninteresting,and the worst of them all,predictable and cliché.A boy and girl fall in love,they are both very different but still in love,then the parents separate them,and they still love each other of course.They don't even really try to contact each other other than Noah that f****** p**** writing 365 unanswered letters a year.Why didn't Allie write to him,huh?Didn't she LOVE HIM?!If she did,she didn't love him THAT much.The characters are extremely one dimensional,have no depth whatsoever,i really couldn't care less what happened to them.Besides James Garner and Gena Rowlands,the acting was so horrible and forced.Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were so annoying and unconvincing as the shallow characters.They had NO chemistry whatsoever(If you want to see AMAZING chemistry,REAL chemistry,watch Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in "To Have and Have Not",and you can easily see the difference between good chemistry and bad).Noah(Ryan Gosling) irritated me the out of all the characters cause he was the typical boring,uninteresting,shallow,and so called "sweet" boy,i mean seriously,no girl in her right mind would date him,in fact,some people might even think he's hiding in the closet somewhere.Seriously,when it comes to a heterosexual relationship-there only needs to be ONE *****,not TWO!What irritates me most is that my mom and sisters LIKE that kind of guy.I mean seriously,my mom and one of my sisters were talking about my sis' ex-boyfriend and after mom said maybe he was too "bad" for her,she suggested that she date someone like "that guy in The Notebook",and right then and there,i rolled my eyes.Guys like that are,what i said,******!Rachel McAdams was irritating as Allie with all her screaming and ****,if she were in a Beatles concert,she would have been PERFECT.Now Rachel McAdams isn't a bad actress,she was good in "Mean Girls" and "Wedding Crashers",but she was just irritating in this movie.Maybe that's the scripts fault.And besides,the movie was barely about a notebook except for the first and last five minutes in the film.They might as well have called it "Not Another ****** Chick Flick".Plus Nicholas Sparks' books are a piece of **** anyway,they are all preachy and predictable and basically the same **** kind of story over and over and over again.Read Ian McEwan,his stories are much more better,convincing,in depth,and realistic and everything else The Notebook isn't.I'll probably edit this review another time,but just listen what i say:Don't Watch Chick Flicks Unless You Are Going To Believe In It Like Fairy Tales. Like many guys, I was roped into watching this film by my girlfriend, and while I was expecting a chick flick that I would not enjoy but that would likely get me laid, nothing could have prepared me for the tidal wave of bullshit I was in for. "The Notebook" is one of the most unimaginitive, exploitive films I have ever seen, and Nicholas Sparks should be curbstomped for every hour he spent churning out this garbage.Let's start with the positives. Cinematography was inoffensive and fellas, if you watch this with your special lady, you're almost sure to get laid.And now on to the negatives. "The Notebook," while masquerading as a love story, in fact, has no story at all. The plot is barely existent, the characters are one-dimensional at best and impossible to like beyond a superficial level, and the storyline is shallower than a children's inflatable pool, existing solely to pimp Sparks's Easy-Bake, feel-good concept of romance. While most "chick-flicks" do their best to create likable characters, humorous situations, and some sort of conflict, "The Notebook" is content to instead show only a slideshow reel of Kodak moments, an abstract representation of our fast-food, home shopping network society's ideal of romance."The Notebook" is exploitive on every single level. In some ways, the film is worse than pornography, the way it masks its sleazy, purely commercial motivation under the guise of presenting a "love" story. In pornography, plot exists solely as a device to get from point A (the film's exposition), to point B (the sex) as quickly as possible. "The Notebook" uses a similar formula, but instead of graphic sex and nudity, this film's golden calf is a perfect, simplistic romance that faces conflict and challenge on the most superficial level possible. There's a massive section of the movie that contains little aside from the couple kissing each other in a variety of settings, all leading up to their first time sleeping together, which is, of course, perfect, just like everything else in this perfect, vacuous storyline.I could go on and on, but I'm only allowed 1,000 words in this particular review. "The Notebook" is a shallow, simplistic, and wholly idiotic view of romance that seems to exist solely to make girls horny, a goal which it achieves remarkably. That being said, the film has no value on any real artistic level, be it storytelling, character development, or even simply on the level of pure entertainment. The entire film plays out like a slideshow you might play at your wedding - highlighting all the good times and ignoring anything that might make it remotely interesting. Everyone involved in the making of this film should feel dirty, especially the film-maker himself, who almost completely destroys the pre-eminence of the Cassavettes name in this one effort. When they laid in the street to watch the lights change, I wanted an ice- cream truck to run them over. It's awful. Another poor-boy-meets rich-girl-and-her-parents-disapprove movie. If only Ryan Gosling's character had fallen from the carnival ride and she'd married the carny dude who had been responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in nearby Lot 7 of the Paramount Studios, then we might have had a movie worth watching. What we need is more of the main characters in trite movies to turn into cybermen with secret yearnings to marry daleks. And they need to eat green jelly beans - a definite sign of a moral deficiency in any character, anywhere. You know that movie that everyone swoons over and you're like the only person who can't stand it and can't understand why so many like it? *sighs* Yeah, this is it. The Notebook—Nicholas Sparks' most notorious story, which reached out to many people and couples. This movie is talked about by almost every single couple I know. And honestlyI don't get why so many people like this movie. I thought this was HORRIBLE!Alright, here's the story. In the 1940's, Noah, played by Ryan Gosling and Allie, played by Rachel McAdams fall in love over the summer, but there's one little problem: The guy's poor and the girl is rich. Yeah, sound familiar (Titanic, Dirty Dancing)? Oh, don't worry; there'll be other clichés along the way. The girl's parents aren't okay with this and the two are separated. World War II happens and the two eventually reconcile after seven years, but things have changed. Allie is now engaged to another guy, who is actually really supportive. So now that Allie has found Noah again, she is now torn between her old flame and her fiancé.So what's the problem? The romance is SO manipulative. For example, how does Noah get Allie's attention at the beginning? He hangs off a Ferris wheel and asks her to date him or he'll let go. Yeah! Suicide! That was the answer to everything! That's right, men! If you want to get the girl of your dreams to go out with you, just threaten to kill yourself in front of her! Yeah, you might die, but hey! Doesn't backfire! And the dialogue between them is SO damn corny and SO cheesy and SO clichéd, it makes me wonder, why should I care about these two after seeing a setup that has been overdone countless other times? And even after he threatens to commit suicide in front of her, they see each other again and they strike up a conversation. Cos that's how women would react, right? She's not at all freaked out by this?! And another thing about it is that they talk and—I'm not kidding here—They're together in literally the next scene as a couple. Just like that. Yeah, it's that rushed.And wouldn't you know it? The fights between these are so forced and half the time, they don't even make sense! After the fight from her parents, he breaks up with her and she's like "get out of here! I don't want to see you again! I hate you!" no, wait come back!". What?!? Does she have multiple personality disorder?! And the second fight near the end is forced. It's written in just to make the movie seem more "dramatic" or a way of saying "ooh, they're so hurt". And the line "I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings". Did a guy who says that he loves her so much really just say that? "Oh, well he's just saying that because he's not afraid to tell her when she's being unfair". Okay, fine. But can you word that a little better?! To me, it sounds like he doesn't care about how she feels! And keep in mind; this is when she is forced to decide who she'll stay with. The fiancée is at least calm towards this and states that he'll never force her into this! The rich guy, who the movie wants you to be against, is the more believable choice!Ugh. I'm sorry, but this movie really ticked me off to see how forced and manipulative the romance is and yet it surprises me to see that so many people really love this movie and how emotionally invested they are in it. Never once did this grip me. I couldn't care less about these people except for the rich guy Allie's engaged to. I couldn't care about the couple, I couldn't care about her problems, I couldn't care about anything!Romance is written in a way for us to relate and hope that the main characters should come out okay in the end after so many hardships. It should be about a real couple, who go through relatable and realistic problems, which act as obstacles. Just show a couple trying to fight their way through hard times and not use these clichés over and over again. Either way, I know a lot of people like this, but as for me, this was god-awful and I will try to stay away from it as much as Allie should have stayed away from Noah to begin with. one of the worst films i have ever seen. poor script, corny, unpoetic, what more can you say? it had me laughing through this awful ordeal. anyone who liked this needs to go back to school. it is nothing more than a midday TV movie. very poor b-grade flick. pityful. weak. unimaginative. i have nothing but contempt for this poor excuse of a film. burn all the copies to wipe it from existence. please! if i could give it -10 i would. it doesn't take much to entertain some people. if you going to watch this for the first time just make sure you have a container to be sick into. you don't want to make a mess of your sofa. a disgrace. a blight in film history. a sickly corny pathetic, piece of rubbish. It's the most cheesiest movie I have ever watched in my life. How, shallow a movie can get is well portrayed in the film "NOTE BOOK." If you'd like to watch a classic love story, with nothing new with no originality please choose this title. It was the worst experience ever. The characters were not very well chosen, and the storyline is too obvious. The script is poorly written. Not to mention that the writer of the book "Note book" is very conventional writer. I don't know how our society accepts a film with no creative spirit. I really think that this would be a great movie for maybe for relaxing time, but there is no need to really involve thinking as a matter of fact. It was a bad experience for me and I would never want to encounter such movies again, would like to stay away from romance genre, if people are calling this a romance movie. A film so sweet, I went into a diabetic coma from watching it. True, I didn't have any high expectations but I rented it nonetheless, simply to see how bad it really was. Seeing a girl whine and bitch about how she isn't allowed to do anything because of her parents is annoying and pathetic enough but when it involves a boarding school that's preparing one for an Ivy League college, this just reaches new levels of ignorance. The theme of finding a true love after spending years shitting your pants and forgetting the names of all those you ever loved except for one stands out as a selfish and sappy moment not to mention the repulsive character Noah dangling himself from a Ferris Wheel to get the girl to go out with him shows desperation beyond anything even I would try. I read the book sometime ago. I read "A Walk to Remember" and loved it, so I figured I'd read this one. I didn't care for it, and when the movie came out, I tried to watch it, thinking it would be better than the book. I think I tried watching this movie twice, and it just did nothing for me. Good thing I rented this movie; it would've stunk if I bought it and weren't able to return it. Nicholas Sparks' novels have made better movies than this one. It just seemed so fairy tale to me; that doesn't happen in real life. I found it to be boring, and I didn't even watch the whole thing. Just couldn't; it seemed to drag like a boring class you have to take. Altho I read more of his books and loved them, this one was my least favorite. It cannot be denied, The Notebook is one of the most successful movies of the modern era. When people list off their favourite movies, The Notebook finds its place somewhere between 1st place and 3rd. My opinion, The Notebook is one of the most boring, corny and overrated movies of all time!When I first saw this movie on DVD, I had a different ending to others where the old people don't die in the end. People say this is the reason why I don't like the movie. I reply with "So you only like the movie because the two old people die in the end?" That's like saying that Jack dying at the end of Titanic is greater than the movie itself, which is a load of absolute cr*p. The story is dull and boring and repetitive and takes bits and pieces from all different love stories and throws them together to create 2 hours of a nauseating love story. The two main characters have no chemistry what-so-ever...and for all you people who gasped when you found out that the old couple was actually Noah and Rachel McAdams (can't even remember the characters name it was so boring) .. if you were actually paying attention to the movie you would have realized it was obvious not even halfway into the movie instead of "awwing" over the characters like a child going gooey over a fluffy bunny.The fact that this movie has turned into a "Notebook" religion is horrible. -I loved it! -Its soo sweet. -Its so sad.When my friend Cait and I switched it on and expected to be sobbing our hearts out by the last act, we were mortified to find that this praised movie was nothing than your usual chick flick that usually just scraps the line of your average telemovie.The movie is a joke. I have to stifle laughter when I see trailers for the movie because it is simply a chick flick with a twist ... a longer duration. Please watch this movie and don't sheep it, sit there and ACTUALLY watch it! Block out the praising and see it for itself ... its nothing special, its not sweet, its not romantic... there is NOTHING memorable about this movie but somewhat everyone seems to go ga-ga over the very title. Notebook schmotebook, if i'm ever made to watch this movie again I will personally place a gun to my head and shoot myself and die with a satisfied smile on my face just as the opening credits start to roll. After reading the book, I was excited when this film came on cable, But I was so disappointed in its rendering of the book! I hope the studios paid the author a lot of money to rewrite his story! The character of Noah was totally changed and I could count on my hands the number of scenes or events that actually occurred in the book! I can't believe how many liberties they took with the story!!! It was totally ruined for me. Entire segments of Noah's life were omitted. Noah was shy and not the type of person to hang himself from a ferris wheel (which never happened in the book). He also never met Ali's parents during the summer Noah and Ali fell in love. (And I don't recall Ali going to Sarah Lawrence.) And what about Ali's art career?? They mention one little picture without indicating how important that picture was to Noah. It's movies like this that make me hate Hollywood and all the talentless producers who wouldn't know a good story if it hit them over the head. Thank goodness for independent films! I hope Nick Sparks goes to an independent director/producer to bring his second book to life--someone who will respect the real story. I went with a girl friend to this movie and we both groaned and laughed (derisively)through this romantic slush. However, the girl friend who recommended this movie had it down as one of her all time favourites - so why the differing opinions? Basically if you enjoy escapism through romance and a happy ending is a must, then this is the movie for you. If you are cynical as far as love and romance is concerned then forget it. The litmus test is ... if you like 'Love Story' you'll enjoy this. The acting is good and the story develops slowly but surely but the subject of the story is purely romance and if you have no interest in this then basically this film is boring. I'm puzzled at how popular this sentimental melodrama is. The on-off couple at the centre of this aren't likable, nor are they believable together. Perhaps it's impossible for me to like it simply because it's intended for a female audience. Don't you wish you, an ordinary but having some romantic ideas teenage boy, get to meet with a rich and innocent beautiful young lady and get to have some amazing love story with her just because you are obsessed?! Yep, every teenager's dream. Now as I turned older, watching this movie again is just torturing.The story is unrealistic, the characters are completely boring and lack of anything special to remember. It feels like just a bunch of normal people who are thrown into a overly dramatized world. This is like watching a movie that some dude become president of the US when he wakes up one morning - perhaps entertaining at the time when you have very little real life experience.We need to stop making movies like this and make more movies that either have more characteristic people and believable storyline or a movie that is about normal people and their realistic drama in life. This film lacked depth. I found the characters trite and annoying. The characters playing the younger versions of the leads were so void of personality that I just didn't care if they ever found each other again. I think this film wanted to be a deep and moving testament to the power of true love. I'm sorry that it lacked that sort of gravity. It was more like the English Patient on a half a Valium and a tab of X. The leads wallow around in sappy, sobbing love scenes that didn't move me as a viewer. The most irritating part was the dismissal of the Young male lead's girlfriend when the female lead moves into the house. They all have coffee and everyone is fine with what is happening. She drives away in her car saying what a great girl the female lead was, after it was well established she had great affection for the male lead.this film was a waste of time. I like Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen. They acted well here but could not save the bland and contrived plot and the awkwardness and cheese oozing out of Ryan Gosling, as a prime example of the unbearable characterization with which the movie's 2nd half is filled. (the 1st half till they broke up at summer is pretty watchable). As Allie turned to leave Noah's house after her mother's visit and Noah broke out in a rage while reciting superfluous dialogue with a stiff palm on his chest, I just could not watch his performance for a second more (good thing there wasn't any more of it)! How on earth does a man sound so justified at getting mad at a woman leaving him, necessarily and potentially temporarily to sort out a melodramatic mess because she's engaged to someone else? Here's a loser who spent all his life missing a girl without any other ostensible ideals or goal in life (given I didn't read the book), and whose morals and maturity, assumed to be sound by default owing to an upbringing of stereotypical paternal love and wisdom, are now collapsing into a heap. Other parts that made me laugh/cringe include widow on the verge of going back to loneliness, her place taken by a prettier and richer girl, experiencing sublime feelings of love and hope, cheesy teary old Noah, and Joan Allen's sudden hysterics of "I love your father". So every rich girl needs a poor boy and then gets split for romance? I always thought the American depiction of love and human nature is much more true to life, but it seems traditions are traditions, from the Qiong Yao and Korean dramas to America in the 40s, lol. For Rachel McAdams I would give it a 6; a 5 for the over-ratedness and complete lack of empathy in characterization.
