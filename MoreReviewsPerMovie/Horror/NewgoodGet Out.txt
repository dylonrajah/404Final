I was totally blown away by "Get Out". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited "fish out of the water" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. "Get out" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick. People will be talking about this one for a long time.Get Out is an extremely powerful, poignant horror movie with some humor. Whatever elements of action or schlock that are present take a backseat to the real human drama that plays out when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's eccentric family.The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date, and Caleb Landry Jones in an appropriately, intensely creepy role. But Kaluuya is the star here, and he delivers with zeal a shocking depth and range of emotions. In fact, more often than not its what he doesn't say that delivers the most impact... which is all to say that this masterpiece could not have been accomplished without the masterful direction of Jordan Peele.Peele builds atmosphere and tension like the Big Bang, dunking you into the mind of the main character while he navigates through very visceral danger.If you're looking for a film that sets out to entertain first and foremost with shock and terror, but also with poignant social commentary and real philosophical meat to chew on, Get Out is the movie you need to see. You won't regret it.This isn't Cabin in the Woods, Peele isn't interested in subverting genre conventions. What he has crafted is entirely original and unique, and thankfully free of clichés or stereotypes. There are no "monsters" here. The real villains are entitlement, egotism, and objectification, and g.d. they are scary! Jordan Peele's Get Out is an outstanding work of horror cinema, in that the American horror film is the best genre for creatively commentating on the various social, economic, and psychological constructs of life in such a way that can be visually thought-provoking. And the best part about this film is Peele does not pull out any of the usual horror tropes or clichés until the showdown. Before you begin to think that Universal Pictures and Blumhouse are pulling a bait-n-switch–selling you a psychological thriller when the film is really a heavy drama–think again. Get Out is every bit a horror film as its more traditional counterparts. In terms of its contribution to the library of horror films, the movie is flawless. From the writing to directing to acting and even the score, editing, and cinematography, Get Out is a film that you should definitely "get out" to watch. With a current 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, this film is certain to grab prolific attention from movie patrons, film studies, and social studies professors alike. It's a brilliant film to discuss in future American horror film classes. Never before has a film been used in such a creative and visceral way to comment on how one culture appropriates the best of another for purposes of exploitation or simply because it has something that you want, and then attempt to change, assimilate, or remove altogether because that which you want is seen as wasted on the originator. "A mind is a terrible thing to waste."It is difficult to explore some of the themes and subtext of this film without giving too much away, but I'm going to try my best to analyze what I can without spoiling anything for those who plan to see the movie. The first element I took note of in the film was the choice of music. Not so much a score (although, there is a score to the film), the music selections in the film serve as an allusion to the overall message and theme in the film. For those who know a little something about music history, you may pick up on the strategic selection and placement of the various songs and musical scores used throughout the film. There are moments in which the music does not seem to match up with the mood or tone of the film–at least, at face value. However, as you delve deeper into the film, you will realize that the music fits in all too well with the plot. I'll give you this: think about the origins of the music in the film when you watch it. Before music, such as jazz and hiphop, became popular amongst a predominantly white society, it originated amongst the black community.Another aspect of the film that hints at the big reveal in the turning point just before the third act is the physique, athletic talent, and sexual stereotypes of black males. You'll notice that clues are dropped here and there, albeit subtly, at the relationship between Rose's family & friends and members of the black community. The worship of Chris' body by many of Rose's family friends makes for an incredibly uncomfortable sequence of encounters at the outdoor picnic. The unsettling weird encounters between Chris and all the people he meets at Rose's family home each work to grow the level of tension and terror in the film–the fear of something dreadful looming on the horizon. Without relying upon a proliferation of jump scares and visceral horror, Peele successfully increases the level of anxiety to terrifying levels in the film. Reminiscent in the ways that Hitchcock or Kubrick may have directed this film–in terms of relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye–Peele incorporates the feeling of uneasiness every moment he can without over saturating the plot. Perfect amount of all the elements that make up the American horror film can be found in this deeply disturbing narrative.This is social commentary on how back males are often exploited for economic gain in areas such as football, basketball, track, and even music and fashion too. So, Peele was using this horror film to comment on how many in the white community have stolen from or appropriated elements from the black community in order to further their own gain or develop ways of entertaining the masses without proper acknowledgement, formal recognition, or even payment. For example, the jazz music at the beginning of the film. That style of music came out of black culture before it was rebranded high class white music for nightclubs, shows, and weddings. Further evidence of this social commentary can be found in other areas of talent that many want to steel for their own and then reprimand the black community or not being 'more white.' I could go on and on. Fascinating stuff! As it is a horror film, do not plan to see it alone. Horror is the one genre that is best experienced in a group setting. Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.Black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) visit Rose's parents for the weekend, where they will meet Chris for the very first time. Staggered by their behaviour from the very off, Chris begins to think all is not right in the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener).I absolutely loved Get Out as both a psychological and satirical horror, Jordan Peele's imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker. Right from the opening sequence, which is one of the best openings to a horror I've seen, I knew this film was going to be special. It felt almost as if I was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut, Peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia.The writing is spot on as well, Peele's background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror. Peele has clearly made Get Out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes, wondering where the film will turn next, which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film. As well as being genuinely creepy, Get Out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve, leaving the audience in the palm of Peele's hand.Peele's confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through Toby Oliver's swift cinematography, akin to work seen in The Shining, and both Michael Abels haunting score and songs picked by Peele to accompany his twisted film.Coming to the performances, Get Out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as Chris Washington, impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows. Expect to see much more of Kaluuya in the future.Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as Rose's parents, who take an immediate interest in Chris' life, both past and present. Get Out gets its truly unsettling performances from Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson as Georgina and Walter, hired by Dean's father. They both have a stand-out scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to. Lil Rel Howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of Chris' best friend, Rod, who doesn't just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it.Get Out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and, as a directorial debut, has to go down as of the best I've seen from Jordan Peele. He's already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and, if they continue to be as good as his debut, I cannot wait. Nervous about meeting his Caucasian girlfriend's parents, a young African American struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller. The film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way. In fact, utterly unsettling as the pre-credits sequence is, it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of 'Get Out' beneath its quirky façade. That said, there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end. The final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the 1970s, complete with appropriate furniture for the period. What really elevates the film though is its social satire. The racism agenda is a little on-the-nose, but the protagonist's anxiety at being a 'token' African American really clicks, forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist. It is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie, 'Get Out' also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority, whether it be by race, religion, gender, age or other factors. "Get Out" is significant in that it simply give the audience a different perspective in the Horror Genre. We have NEVER been given a hero of color in horror; "The Black guy always gets killed"; Night of the Living Dead (1968) could have been the first but they blew it. Duane Jones' character should have lived!!! ...but I digress. We FINALLY have a the black guy as the protagonist thanks solely to Jordan Peele of, the dynamic Key and Peele fame. Peele has made the horror film he always wanted to see. Given the box office results as so far and Rotten Tomatoes', rare 100% fresh rating, this is the horror film that many of us wanted to see!!! It is a very straight forward story about a black male in an interracial relationship that is about to meet his girlfriend's parents...everything else after this point is horror film GOLD!!!No need to spoil anything here, this film is fun and entertaining to say the least. The social commentary is not to preachy but just enough to feel true. Go see it and have fun with it. Thank you Jordan Peele!! That movie was an amazing movie, it may not be that scary but its story is very thrilling. Daniel K is a good actor with his perfect portrayal of the character Chris. The movie wasn't scary to be frank but more entertaining than most horror movies. Each scene in the movie means a thousand words.Allison Williams also played a great role as the movie villain ranging from an innocent woman who dates a black guy to a crazy and monstrous woman ready to kill to have her victim's colored body hosted by older non-blacks.In all, the movie was entertaining and covered the area of racial discrimination in the United States in a creative, plot twisting way. I recommend this movie for all , from going to old. Get Out is a decent horror movie, better than average, but not without its set backs.
It absolutely didn't deserve an oscar, let alone for screenplay, but it's not the worst choice in the world at the end of the day.
For a debut film this is pretty admirable and could mean a lot for horror movies, black people and the general film industry, but aside from the politics of the film, it really is just an ok horror.The VVitch and It Follows are much, much better horror films; deserving of much more praise, but because THIS horror film has a discussion about race it gets millions of dollars and awards and praise. Is this a bad thing?Not really. It's better than giving an award to something like another shat out Blumhouse/James Wan sequel with no talent or effort put into it.Basically, the best thing about the film is the actors and their performances, especially Daniel Kaluuya, who is as excellent as always.The worst thing about the film would probably have to be the "horror" elements since it's incredibly one- note and unoriginal in this department. Not saying it's bad, but it doesn't do anything the horror genre hasn't seen a bunch of times already.It's good, not great. (But still kinda cool a horror film won an oscar since the last was in 2000 with The Sixth Sense.) From the opening credits to the closing credits Jordan Peele had me locked in. Such an amazing job by an amazing director. To think that Peele stopped writing this 20 times is insane! Well done! Can't wait to see what the future holds in regards to Jordan Peele films. Ok , firstly , for everyone that says this movie is racist , is not , just shows the struggles of black people in a world of white people ( there are documentaries on this ).
Secondly the plot twists in this are fucking amazing ( and only to the end , one of them becomes predictable , if you are not that idiot :)) ).To conclude everything i wrote , i must say , for everyone interested in psychology or in the human mind , go watch this please :D. GET OUT is outstanding. By now you've heard the premise, a young black photographer decides to spend a weekend with his white lover's family for the first time . What he encounters is to be expected, and also unexpected beyond the beyond. Jordan Peele really gets the horror film, and all its comedic potential. that's all i'm gonna say. You've got to watch this one. Amazing movie,just keeps you thinking what's gonna happen.Comedy,horror,thriller,suspense all in one movie. This film is so much more than your standard horror movie. If anything, it's much more a suspense movie with a devious twist. The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.The interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.In that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.When it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.The acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.10/10. See this movie and see it often. this is a small masterpiece, very well crafted the aesthetic and the mood starts out as a typical comedy with black actors and some elements of horror i watched the movie on DVD and didn't know anything about it really judging from the cover i thought i would watch a "so bad its actually good" flick with overacting and familiar toilet humor i got a lot more than what i has bargained for all the clichés in movies especially comedies with black actors are here, the scared black man, the white man trying to act politically correct, the obese funny but silly best friend and an antagonist, the mother, portrayed by an actress more often playing a mature but sexually charged leading lady with a slightly brown skin tone than a villain all the clichés are here only to be reversed during the second half of the movie we don't have a dark or ambiguous ending but a very cathartic one justifyingly following the disturbing sci-fi climax as a Greek citizen who has lived among foreigners in another European country for several months in the past, its funny but i could actually relate to both white and black characters i have been both racist and a victim of racism on several occasions so that at least to a small extent i know how it feels both when you look down upon someone and when you are looked down upon as a mostly Caucasian male with dark hair and a not so light complexion, coming from a small Balkan country i am entertained at how the movie has obviously irritated some people which validates its intended polarizing power and i also liked the fact that the writer didn't jump on the anti-trump train but instead subtly satirized Obama's politics which becomes more on-point as the original premise of the film is that classic 60s movie with Sidney Poitier aka the first on screen Obama offered to the audiences worldwide there is a truth that resonates in this seemingly otherworldly entertaining movie and i was more that happy to listen to it and reflect on it PS i haven't seen anyone referencing rosemary's baby one of the many nods to challenging horror movies of the past within the film interestingly enough, Polanski has depicted paranoia in another film of his in a similar to Get Out racially charged manner in The Tenant as a Polish (aka white but Slavic) man portrayed by Polansky himself located in an unfriendly towards emigrants Paris in the 1970s and accompanied by an indifferent and emotionally cold french girlfriend 10/10 I won't even bother telling you the premise. I'm sure you know it. What I will say is that this has extremely tight writing. The plot twists hold up. I can't think of a single plot hole, and I'm one of those people who obsessively tears apart films looking for those (I don't usually have to even try).I have a mixed race family, and I say it's extremely relevant, politically, racially, in today's world. It's not an anti-white film, it's not calling all white people racist, or anyone racist, it's just probably using some dialog the writer/director has probably heard a million times in conversations with white people in high society.It's not a horror movie as it's listed on IMDb and by most viewers. It has some horror elements, but it's really a suspense movie, and it's a very good one because for the first half of the movie or more, you have a growing sense of dread, and you have no idea why. To top it off, it has some very funny parts, but they don't ruin the suspense because the funny man is on the other end of a phone, the protagonist's only link to the outside world, as it were, and so it is compartmentalized and doesn't diminish the very real threat he is facing. I am by no means a professional troll, here to say that my opinion is relevant. However, this movie was FANTASTIC, but again, that is just my 2 cents. For a debut in directing, especially when it's Jordan Peele, I was awestruck. Not for my lack in trust in his ability, but this was a horror/thriller, and I have known his work for always being something more along the lines of side splitting hilarity. I heard he directed this film, often times, doing his impressions of President Obama (how I miss thee) and his other well known impressions. I also hear that Jordan took notes from the late and great George A. Romero, in creating the story around a black man as the protagonist, which really how often do we see that? Always refreshing to see a new perspective in an old genre. If you really want to see a new look unto "meeting the family" of your significant other, watch this movie. Especially if you are wasting your precious times reading reviews like mine, and others. Take the 90 mins or so and sit back. The soundtrack also worth listening. I give it a 10 out of 10. This is nothing like Keanu, but it's still a great movie. Kukdos, Mr. Jordan Peele, I was already a fan, but now, I am much cooler. XO I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I've not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.Brilliant, 10/10 I loved this movie, it was disturbing, and affected my sleep, yet I would highly recommend it! This was by far the best movie of 2017. When I saw it in theatres my first time, I was bloen away. by the end, the audience was clapping and screaming for more. It was so well done and wonderfully written. I saw it two more times in theatres and every time the audience gave the same reaction. I think that's a true testiment to a movie. When you can make your audience so passionate, thats real magic. This movie had promise and boy, did it deliver. I love the concept of the story, and they did a great job and pulling this off. It was truly a great film which I've watched a handful of times already. It hits many of different emotions, which most great films achieve. Go watch for yourself and hope you too will enjoy it as much as I did. Beautifully written from beginning to end. The kind of film that makes you feel sick, but simply because it's doing it's job perfectly. The twists were beautifully timed and never over-the-top, and any predictability in this movie never ruined this film. Refreshing cast, great script, great energy, great camera motion, nothing cheesy, great supporting actors, and thank god for the relief in the end. STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningChris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are a mixed race couple, who are travelling to meet Rose's parents, Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a retired neuro-surgeon, for the weekend. While they seem fairly nice, Chris can't help but pick up loads of subtle little knocks at his African American heritage (most notably, learning Dean's grandfather was robbed of his dream at the 1936 Olympics by Jesse Owens.) One night, Missy puts Chris under a teacup induced hypnotic trance, and from there he finds himself plunged into a series of increasingly twisted events, from which he ends up battling for survival.The horror genre is in a pretty desperate state of affairs at the moment, certainly not a patch on its heyday twenty/thirty years ago. When they're not remaking old classics, they're just making films that rely on cheap jump scares in place of anything that really gets under your skin. And so, it's a really nice surprise when something like Get Out comes along, which gives you faith that there's still life in the old dog yet. First time director Jordan Peele gets back to basics with what traditionally made the genre so great, in a film that's also from the producers of such hits as Insidious and The Gift.Peele understands that a creepy air of mystery and a foreboding sense of the unknown are far more effective tools than cheap shocks and gore, and what works in Get Out's favour so well is a genuinely intriguing and exciting story that really leaves you wondering what is going on, when it will kick off and how it will all work out. It's brave, as well, tackling the themes of an inter-racial relationship in the modern world, and constructing one of the most paranoid and outlandish reasons for what could be behind it. There's some light and humour, as well, with subtle little digs and nods thrown in that few will be unlikely to pick up on.As a horror fan, this emerges as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. ***** There was enormous hype surrounding this film, which is the main reason I watched it, but also the main reason why I felt uncomfortable watching it for a long time before that. If you are reading this, it's probably too late to not watch the trailer or read the commentaries on it, but I am warning you anyway. Because it is a racially loaded film, there are a lot of people who focus on that for some reason. Also, while I gave it a full ten stars, this is compared to other thrillers, not movies in general. That said, the film is a slow paced thriller. Things start cool, then they get weirder and weirder until the final climax. The story is ingenious, but nothing you haven't seen before in such movies. What I found interesting was the acting, the direction and the script, so all the qualities that I enjoy in a movie. Jordan Peele obviously did a good job, but Daniel Kaluuya (my man) hit all the right notes. The hallmark of a good thriller (perhaps of any genre) is that it has a main character that you can relate to, and "Chris Washington" did all the things I believe a normal person would do in that situation. What this film did not have: jump scares (well, they had one, but it was at the beginning and I can forgive it), group of friends building fear off each other, people that behave dumb, hysterical or malevolent just to make the story less boring, a predictable script. Well, it was kind of predictable, but I'd read the reviews, hence my warning. The story also lends itself to nice prequels and even sequels, but I think it said what it was set to say. I also liked that they didn't try to explain it too much: stuff just happens and it's the point of view of the lead character that takes precedence over everything else, while the role of the viewer is to interpret it as they see fit. What could have gone better: editing out the scene at the beginning with the other black guy.  Bottom line: a nail-biting success. Worth watching. Also, check out the alternate ending of the movie, that is roaming the Internet out there. Best Picture Nominee:I've seen "Get Out" twice now. Once with a group of friends way after it released on Blu-Ray and the second time in theaters during the Oscars 2017 Best Picture Festival and both times I have loved this film."Get Out" strikes this perfect balance of being a comedy and a horror film, while simultaneously being social commentary about racism.The political message works really well here, but it's not the only thing going for it, which can often times be the case for films that push a strong political agenda.The entire cast did so well, that I was scared for Chris and genuinely creeped out by the entire Armitage family. The setup is near perfect, building up the appropriate amount of suspense that we needed for the later half of the film, with the ending keeping me on the edge of my seat literally until the very last scene.I'm glad that "Get Out" won Best Screenplay and if it had won Best Picture, I wouldn't have complained at all. If you haven't seen it yet, go give it a watch!
